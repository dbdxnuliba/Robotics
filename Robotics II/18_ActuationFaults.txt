Detection and isolation

Fault diagnosis problems
n

n

in the diagnosis of faults possibly affecting a (nonlinear)
dynamic system various problems can be formulated
Fault Detection
n

n

discriminate which particular fault 𝑓 has occurred out of a (large)
class of potential ones, by distinguishing it from any other fault and
from the effects of disturbances possibly acting on the system

Fault Identification
n

n

recognize that the malfunctioning of the (controlled) system is due
to the occurrence of a fault (or not proper behavior) affecting some
physical or functional component of the system

Fault Isolation
n

n

-1

determine the time profile (and/or class type) of the isolated fault 𝑓

Fault Accommodation
n

Robotics 2

modify the control law so as to compensate for the effects of the
detected and isolated fault (possibly also identified)

definition of an auxiliary dynamic system (Residual Generator)
whose output will depend only on the presence of the fault 𝑓 to be
detected and isolated (and not on any other fault or disturbance)
and will converge asymptotically to zero when 𝑓 ≡ 0 (stability)
in case of many potential faults, each component 𝑟% of the vector 𝑟
of residuals will depend on one and only one associated fault 𝑓%
(possibly reproducing approximately its time behavior)
many of the FDI schemes are model-based: they use a nominal
(fault- and disturbance-free) dynamic model of the system

Fault Tolerant Control

Robotics 2

passive: control scheme that is intrinsically robust to uncertainties
and/or faults (typically having only moderate/limited effects)
active: control scheme involving a reconfiguration after FDI (with
guaranteed performance for the faulted system)

FDI method based on generalized momentum is easily extended to the
presence of flexible transmissions (elastic joints), actuator dynamics, …
the scheme can be made adaptive, so as to handle parametric
uncertainties in the robot dynamic model
the method can be modified for detection and isolation of significant
classes of sensor faults (e.g., faults in force/torque sensor at the wrist)
n

n

assuming non-concurrency (at most a single fault occurs at the same
time) of a given set of faults, relaxed FDI conditions have been derived
n
n

n

n

applies to all faults that instantaneously affect robot acceleration or torque
(i.e., occurring at the second-order differential level)

of interest when the necessary conditions for multiple FDI are violated
involves processing of continuous residuals + discrete logic for isolation

the same FDI-type approach has been applied also for compensation of
unmodeled friction (treated as a “permanent fault” on the system)
combination of model- and signal-based approaches to FDI
