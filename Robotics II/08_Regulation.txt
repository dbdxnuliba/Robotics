§ allows to estimate the time needed to ”approximately” converge: for 𝑐 = 1,
in 𝑡 − 𝑡> = 3 × the time constant 𝜏 = 1/𝜆, the initial error is reduced to 5%
§ typically, this is a local property only (within some maximum finite radius 𝛿 )

Qualitative comparison
no saturation of commands: in principle, much larger gains can be used
better prediction of settling times: local exponential convergence (designed
on the linear approximation of the robot dynamics around (𝑞| , 0))
“fine tuning” of control gains is easier, but still a tedious and delicate task

robot data: links are uniform thin rods
no gravity (horizontal plane)
rest-to-rest motion task:
𝑞(0) = (0, 0) (straight) → 𝑞| = (𝜋/3, 𝜋/2)
interpolating trajectory: cubic polynomials
three case studies
a) low gains (overdamped) 𝐾ƒ = diag 80, 40 , 𝐾„ = diag 60, 30
vs interpolating trajectory in 𝑇 = 2 s
b) medium gains (very overdamped) 𝐾ƒ = diag 200, 100 , 𝐾„ = diag 200, 100
vs interpolating trajectory in 𝑇 = 2 s
c) high gains 𝐾ƒ = diag 1250, 180 , 𝐾„ = diag 200, 70
vs interpolating trajectory in 𝑇 = 1 s, with torque saturation 𝑢#,•–— = 30 Nm,
𝑢$,•–— = 10 Nm
