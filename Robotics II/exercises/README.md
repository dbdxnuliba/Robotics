# Robotics I
## Exercises

This repository includes the code solution of some exercises on Robotics I course (by prof. Alessandro de Luca). No great commenting is implemented since the whole explanation of the procedure is described with detail in the documents. In addition to the toolbox help, some customs methods were implemented to ease calculations.

Formulation of the tests and analytical solutions can be found [here](http://www.diag.uniroma1.it/~deluca/rob1_en/material_rob1_en.html).

#### Toolbox

Peter Corke robotics toolbox is used to generate a 3D representation of the models and plot trajectories.
