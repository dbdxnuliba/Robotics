## A recursive algorithm for calculating Christoffel symbols

The repo contains various folders:
----------------------------------
1- Computational complexity: contains the details on the operation count for the recursive algorithm

2- Christoffel Symbolic: contains the scripts used for generating symbolic equations (using Lagrangian) for calculating Christoffel symbols of a robot defined by its DH and inertial parameters. The generated equations are stored in a file on the HDD.

3- Testing: contains a testing script, which compares the performance of the recursive algorithm and the symbolic equations for calculating Christoffel symbols. The tests are carried out on 5 and 6 Degrees of Freedom robot, their DH and inertial parameters are defined in separate (.mat) files.

Each of the folders contains a ReadMe file with more details.
