/************************************************************************/
/* This directory contains the code for inverse kinematics 
/* of a General 6R robot.*/
/* The executable is based on an earlier implementation*/
/* by Dr. Dinesh Manocha of UNC						*/
/************************************************************************/

Steps to run executable:

1. Double click General6R.exe.
2. The executable reads input from input.dat.
3. Output is generated as output.dat.
4. User can modify the contents of input.dat.
5. For a definition of the DH parameters used, please visit
http://www.roboanalyzer.com/uploads/2/5/8/8/2588919/dhparams.pdf

The input has the following format: (see files *.dat for examples)

a1 a2 ... a6   
b1 b2 ... b6
alpha1 alpha2 ... alpha6

R11 R12 R13
R21 R22 R23
R31 R32 R33
T1  
T2  
T3

comments: ai's are link lengths,
	      bi's are joint offsets,
		  alphai's are the twist angles,
          R* is the rotation component of the end-effector, 
	  and T* is translation part.


The output of The executable is the values of Theta1 ... Theta6.
