since the E-L equations involve only linear operations on 𝑇 and 𝑈, also
the robot dynamic model is linear in the standard parameters 𝝅 ∈ ℝB)G

Linearity in the dynamic parameters
n

using a 𝑁 × 10𝑁 regression matrix 𝑌S that depends only on kinematic
quantities, the robot dynamic equations can always be rewritten linearly
in the standard dynamic parameters as

𝑀 𝑞 𝑞̈ + 𝑐 𝑞, 𝑞̇ + 𝑔 𝑞 = 𝑌S 𝑞, 𝑞,̇ 𝑞̈ 𝜋 = 𝑢
𝜋 A = 𝜋BA
n

𝜋8A

⋯

𝜋G

the open kinematic chain structure of the manipulator implies that the 𝑖 -th
dynamic equation can depend only on the standard dynamic parameters
of links 𝑖 to 𝑁 ⇒ 𝑌S has a block upper triangular structure

with row vectors
𝑌',[ of size 1×10

Property: element 𝑚'[ of 𝑀(𝑞) is a function at most of (𝑞]^B , ⋯ , 𝑞G ), for 𝑘 = min{𝑖, 𝑗} ,
and of the inertial parameters of at most links 𝑟 to 𝑁 , with 𝑟 = max{𝑖, 𝑗}

many standard parameters do not appear (“play no role”) in the dynamic model of a
given robot ⇒ the associated columns of 𝑌S are 0!
some standard parameters may appear only in fixed combinations with others ⇒ the
associated columns of 𝑌S are linearly dependent!
one can isolate 𝑝 ≪ 10𝑁 independent groups of parameters 𝜋 (associated to 𝑝
functionally independent columns 𝑌'jklm of 𝑌S ) and partition matrix 𝑌S in two
blocks, the second containing dependent (or zero) columns as 𝑌klm = 𝑌'jklm 𝑇, for a
suitable constant 𝑝 × (10𝑁 − 𝑝) matrix 𝑇

these grouped parameters are called dynamic coefficients 𝑎 ∈ ℝm , “the only that
matter” in robot dynamics (= base parameters by W. Khalil)
the minimal number 𝑝 of dynamic coefficients that is needed can also be checked

Identification experiments
1. choose a motion trajectory 𝑞k (𝑡) that is sufficiently “exciting”, i.e.,
§ explores the robot workspace and involves all components in the
robot dynamic model
§ is periodic, with multiple frequency components
2. execute this motion (approximately) by means of a control law
§ taking advantage of any available information on the robot model
§ often 𝑢 = 𝐾{ (𝑞k − 𝑞) + 𝐾| (𝑞̇ k − 𝑞)
̇ (PD, no model information used)
3. measure 𝑞 (encoders) in 𝑛6 time instants (and, if available, also 𝑞̇ )
§ joint velocity 𝑞̇ and acceleration 𝑞̈ can be later estimated off line by
numerical differentiation (use of non-causal filters is feasible)
4. with such measures/estimates, evaluate the regression matrix 𝑌 (on the
left) and use the applied commands 𝑢 (on the right) in the expression
