Need for calibration
n

n

tolerances in mechanical construction and in assembly of
links/joints imply small errors in actual end-effector pose
(real ≠ nominal parameters)
encoder mounting on motor axes may not be consistent
with the “zero reference” of the robot direct kinematics
(joint angle measures are constantly biased)
errors distributed “along” the arm are amplified, due to the
open chain kinematic structure of most robots
calibration goal: recover as much as possible E-E pose
errors by correcting the nominal set of D-H parameters,
based on independent external (accurate!) measurements
experiments to be done once for each robot, before
starting operation... (and maybe repeated from time to time)

Final comments
n

an iterative least squares method
n

n

it is useful to calibrate first and separately those quantities that are less
accurate (typically, the encoder bias)
n

n

n

more complex than D-H parameters, but leading to a better numerical
conditioning of the regressor matrix in calibration algorithm
one such description uses the POE (Product Of Exponential) formula

more in general, 6 base parameters should also be included
n

n

keeping the remaining ones at their nominal values

alternative kinematic descriptions can be used
n

n

original problem is nonlinear in the unknowns, then linearized using firstorder Taylor expansion

to locate 0-th robot frame w.r.t. world coordinate frame (of external sensor)

accurate calibration/estimation of real parameters is a general problem
in robotics (and beyond...)
