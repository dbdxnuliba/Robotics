A robot manipulator having generalized coordinates q ∈ Rn and dynamic model
M (q)q̈ + c(q, q̇) + g(q) = u,

(1)

with inertia matrix M , Coriolis and centrifugal terms c, and gravity vector g, should perform a task that
is described in terms of variables x = f (q) ∈ Rm , with m < n, and is specified by a smooth desired task
trajectory x = xd (t), for t ≥ 0.
Provide the expressions of the feedback laws that solve the following control problems, in which we consider
different objectives and different feasible command inputs for the robot system. In the first three cases,
possible errors in the execution of the desired task trajectory should be recovered in an exponential way.
For all cases, give also some hints on the physical meaning of the pursued solution.
1. Assume the joint velocity q̇ ∈ Rn as control input. Execute the desired m-dimensional task trajectory
by minimizing instantaneously the objective function

Provide next the symbolic expressions of all the terms needed in the control laws for problems 1 and 2
when the robot is the RP planar arm (n = 2) of Fig. 1, the task variable is a scalar (m = 1) given by
x = f (q) = q2 cos q1 , and the desired task trajectory is xd (t) = L + L(1 − cos ωt)/4, for some constants
L > 0 and ω > 0. The robot starts at rest in a generic configuration q1 (0) = q10 > 0, q2 (0) = q20 > 0.
