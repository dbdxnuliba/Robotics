Figure 1: A 2R polar robot with associated link frames.
The 2R polar robot shown in Fig. 1 moves in the presence of gravity and has links of cylindric
form and uniformly distributed mass. Its dynamic model is

• Give a physical interpretation of the inertia matrix elements that confirms their correctness.
• Write down all expressions of feedback control laws for τ that you are aware of, which
guarantee regulation to a desired (generic) constant configuration q d . Specify for each law
the design conditions for success and the type of convergence/stability achieved.
Exercise 2
In inverse dynamics problems for serial manipulators, the most efficient implementations are based
on a numerical Newton-Euler (NE) algorithm that contains a forward recursive (FR) part, which
computes from the base to the tip all relevant differential kinematic terms associated to the links,
and a backward recursive (BR) part, which computes from the tip to the base the exchanged
forces/torques between links. Suppose now that we compute the (linear/angular) acceleration
vector p̈ ∈ R6 of the end-effector by
p̈ = N EF R(q, q̇, q̈) = J (q)q̈ + J̇ (q)q̇,
where N EF R denotes compactly the FR part only of the NE algorithm.
• How can the N EF R algorithm be used to evaluate numerically and separately the Jacobian
matrix J and the product term J̇ q̇? How many times is the algorithm called in total?
• With the same algorithm, can we evaluate also the matrix J̇ alone? If so, how?

Exercise 3
Consider a planar 3R robot with unitary link lengths. Taking into account robot redundancy, a
kinematic control scheme is active at the velocity level so as to track a desired end-effector position
trajectory, while trying to locally maximize the minimum Cartesian distance of the robot body
from obstacles.

Figure 2: A planar 3R robot moving its !end effector in the presence of an obstacle.
• In the shown configuration q = (30◦ , −30◦ , 30◦ ) and with a single obstacle placed as in Fig. 2,
the robot end effector is assigned a unitary velocity v in the positive x0 direction. Specify one
particular kinematic control scheme achieving at best both tasks, and provide the associated
numerical value of the command vector q̇ ∈ R3 .
• Compare with a minimum velocity norm solution that neglects the presence of the obstacle.
