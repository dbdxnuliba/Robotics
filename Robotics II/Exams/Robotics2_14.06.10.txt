Exercise 1
Consider a planar 3R robot with unitary link lengths as in Fig. 1. Taking into account the
robot redundancy, a velocity control scheme is active so as to track desired end-effector position
trajectories while trying to locally maximize the minimum Cartesian distance of the robot body
from the obstacles.
• In the shown configuration q = (30◦ , −30◦ , 30◦ ), the end-effector is assigned a unitary velocity
v in the positive x0 direction. Specify the velocity control scheme and provide the associated
numerical value of the command vector q̇ ∈ R3 .
• Compare with a minimum velocity norm solution that neglects the presence of the obstacle.

Exercise 2
The two-mass flexible system in Fig. 2 moves under gravity and is subject to a control force F . The
position coordinates q1 and q2 have their zero in a position where the elastic spring is undeformed.
• Derive the dynamic model assuming that all friction effects can be neglected.
• Determine all forced equilibrium configurations of the system.
• Design a feedforward plus linear feedback control scheme using only measurements of the
position q1 and velocity q̇1 of the first mass, which is able to regulate the position of the
second mass to a constant desired position q2,d .
• Prove the global asymptotic (actually, exponential) stability of the desired closed-loop equilibrium. Hint: The closed-loop system dynamics is affine, and a simple analysis can be made
by linearizing the system around the desired equilibrium, which removes constant terms.
