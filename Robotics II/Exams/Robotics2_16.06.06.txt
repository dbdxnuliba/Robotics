Figure 1: A 2R polar robot
Derive the dynamic model of a 2R polar robot moving in the presence of gravity, using the generalized coordinates q = (q1 , q2 ) defined in Fig. 1. Assume that the links have cylindric form (as in
the picture) and uniformly distributed mass.
Provide for this robot the explicit expression of the terms of an adaptive control law that guarantees
asymptotic tracking of a desired smooth joint trajectory q d (t), without any a priori knowledge
about the robot dynamic parameters. Which is the minimum dimension of such an adaptive
controller?
Exercise 2
For the robot in Fig. 1, write down all different symbolic expressions of control laws that you are
aware of, which guarantee regulation to a desired (generic) constant configuration q d . Specify for
each law the design conditions for success and the type of convergence/stability achieved.

Exercise 1
The definition of the joint variables q1 and q2 follows the Denavit-Hartenberg convention. We show
in Fig. 2 the two DH frames attached to the two moving links (and indexed with 1 and 2), which
will be used for defining conveniently their inertial parameters. The rotation matrices between
frames 0 and 1 and between frames 1 and 2 are found easily by inspection (without the need of
explicitly defining a DH table of parameters) as


R1 (q1 ) =  sin q1 0 − cos q1  ,
R2 (q2 ) =  sin q2

Since the cylindric links have uniform mass, their center of mass will lie along the y 1 -axis for link
1 and along the x2 -axis for link 2. We denote with d2 > 0 the distance of the center of mass of
link 2 from the axis of joint 1 (slightly more than half of the link length). The inertia matrix of
each link is diagonal when referred to the kinematic reference frame attached to the link, as well
as when referred to the frame with origin in the center of mass and having the same orientation.
We denote the link inertia matrices in the latter case as

Figure 2: The reference frames used for defining link inertial parameters of the 2R polar robot
We start by computing the various terms in the robot dynamic model, following a Lagrangian
approach.
The kinetic energy of the robot is T = T1 + T2 . For the first link,

For the second link, the position of its center of mass is


d2 cos q2 cos q1
pc2 =  d2 cos q2 sin q1  ,
`1 + d2 sin q2
T1 =

where `1 is the length of link 1 (an irrelevant kinematic parameter for what follows). Thus, its
velocity is


−d2 cos q2 sin q1 q̇1 − d2 cos q1 sin q2 q̇2
v c2 = ṗc2 =  d2 cos q2 cos q1 q̇1 − d2 sin q1 sin q2 q̇2  ,
d2 cos q2 q̇2
and its squared norm simplifies to

kv c2 k2 = v Tc2 v c2 = d22 q̇22 + cos2 q2 q̇12 .
The angular velocity of link 2, when expressed in frame 0, is computed as1

In order to use the constant diagonal inertia matrix of link 2, we need to express the angular
velocity in frame 2. Since

We note that in general I2x 6= I2y , whereas it is I2y = I2z , due to the cylindric form and uniform
mass distribution of the links. Therefore,

Using the following definition of dynamic coefficients

Although there will be no reduction in the number of dynamic coefficients, it is slightly more
convenient to use the trigonometric identity cos2 q2 = 1 − sin2 q2 and obtain

g0 = 9.81 [m/s2 ]

and the potential energy U1 is constant, we only need the z-component of the position vector r 0,c2

U1 = cost,

U2 = m2 g0 d2 sin q2 = a4 sin q2 ,
