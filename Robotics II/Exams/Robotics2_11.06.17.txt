Consider a 2R planar robot with equal links of unitary length, uniformly distributed link masses,
and moving in the horizontal plane. During free motion, the robot dynamics is
B(q)q̈ + c(q, q̇) = τ ,
where
B(q) =

a1 + 2a2 cos q2

a3 + a2 cos q2

a3 + a2 cos q2

a3

!
c(q, q̇) =

−a2 sin q2 q̇2 (q̇2 + 2q̇1 )
a2 sin q2 q̇12

!
,

and with the dynamic coefficients a1 , a2 , and a3 being known (their numerical value is not essential
in the following).
In the configuration q = (0, π/4) [rad] and with q̇ = (0, −π/2) [rad/s], the robot is hit by an
instantaneous planar Cartesian force F = (−10, 0) [N] applied at the midpoint of the second link.
1. Determine the explicit expression of the feedback control law for the joint torque vector τ that
minimizes in norm the resulting instantaneous joint acceleration q̈. Provide the associated
expression of kq̈k.
2. What are the robot sensing requirements for achieving this result? How could we design
a dynamic control law for the torque τ that approximates this same robot behavior when
having only joint position and velocity measurements available?

June 17, 2011
When the 2R planar robot is hit at a given state (q, q̇) by a force F , its dynamics becomes
B(q)q̈ + c(q, q̇) = τ + J Tk (q)F ,

(1)

where the Jacobian J k (q) is associated to the collision point, in the present case the midpoint of the
second link. Taking into account the kinematic data and the collision configuration q = (0, π/4),
we have
!
− sin q1 − 0.5 sin(q1 + q2 ) −0.5 sin(q1 + q2 )
J K = J k (q)|q=(0,π/4) =
cos q1 + 0.5 cos(q1 + q2 )
0.5 cos(q1 + q2 )
q=(0,π/4)

The instantaneous joint acceleration q̈ in response to the collision force F and to an applied
torque τ at the joints will be


q̈ = B −1 (q) τ + J Tk (q)F − c(q, q̇) .
Therefore, the control torque
τ = τ (q, q̇, F ) = c(q, q̇) − J Tk (q)F

(2)

will produce q̈ = 0, which is the minimum possible acceleration (kq̈k = 0, and the robot will
continue its motion unperturbed by the collision). In order to be realizable, this control law should
have access to a (direct or indirect) instantaneous measure of F , beyond measuring the internal
state of the robot. Moreover, the collision point (assumed to be at the midpoint of the second
link in the formulation) should also be known exactly in order to use the correct J Tk (q). These
two requirements could be matched in principle if there is a camera observing the scene and/or a
surface touch sensor capable of measuring the collision force (if different from the assumed one).
If this can be accomplished, the actual value of the control torque at the collision instant is
computed using

where the dynamic coefficient a2 is known.
Indeed, the above situation is quite restrictive. In order to get rid of extra sensing and measurements, we could use the concept of model-based residuals to estimate at once the global quantity
τk = J k (q)T F
needed in the control action (2). In fact, we can generate on line the following (here, twodimensional) residual signal r

r = K I B(q)q̇ −

for K I > 0, typically diagonal, and where the matrix C(q, q̇) is a factorization of the Coriolis and
centrifugal terms that satisfies
c(q, q̇) = C(q, q̇)q̇, s.t. Ḃ(q) − 2C(q, q̇) is skew-symmetric ⇒ Ḃ(q) = C(q, q̇) + C T (q, q̇). (5)
Such a matrix always exists and can be computed, e.g., using the Christoffels symbols. From (4),
using the dynamics (1) and the property (5), it follows that the evolution of r satisfies


ṙ = K I B(q)q̈ + Ḃ(q)q̇ − C T (q, q̇)q̇ − r − τ


= K I τ + τ k − C(q, q̇)q̇ + Ḃ(q)q̇ − C T (q, q̇)q̇ − r − τ
= K I (τ k − r) .
Therefore, r is a low-pass stable first-order filter of the unknown signal τ k with bandwidth going
to infinity for increasingly larger K I . Its evaluation in (4) requires only the proprioceptive measurements q and q̇ (beside, and as before, a reasonable accuracy for the dynamic model of the
robot) and the available of the command τ being applied to the robot.
As a result, the control law (2) can be replaced by
τ = c(q, q̇) − r,
and the resulting robot behavior approximated at a low expense.
