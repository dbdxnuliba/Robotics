Robotics II

A KUKA LWR has its base mounted on a vertical wall as illustrated in Fig. 1, where the robot is
shown in its zero configuration. Consider a situation in which the last three joints (constituting a
spherical wrist with center at W = O6 ) are permanently frozen at their zero values.
For kinematic and dynamic analysis, use the DH frame assignment as in the figure and assume
that l1 = l2 = l3 = l4 = l5 (while l0 and l6 are different). Frame 7 is drawn for clarity in a displaced
position, but is actually located on the final flange of the robot at a distance l6 from W . Each link
has mass mi (i = 0, 1, . . . , 7, including the base) and its center of mass is on one of the axes of the
DH frame attached to it. In particular, for the first six bodies, the center of mass lies along the
(positive direction of) axis z i for orange/even links (i = 0, 2, 4) or along the (negative direction of)
axis y i for yellow/odd links (i = 1, 3, 5). For links 6 and 7, the two centers of mass are collocated
with O6 and O7 , respectively.

• Let θ ∈ R4 be the variables of the first four active joints. Determine the symbolic expression
of the gravity term g(θ) ∈ R4 of this 4-dof dynamic model of the LWR robot.
• Find all unforced equilibrium configurations of the 4-dof structure.
