Consider the one-dimensional mass/spring/damper scheme of a robot in contact with a compliant
workpiece and with a force sensing cell in between, as shown in Fig. 1. The robot and the workpiece
are represented by the mass mr > 0, with position xr , and by the mass mw > 0, with position xw ,
respectively. The rest positions of the springs modeling the stiffness ks > 0 of the force sensor and
the stiffness kw > 0 of the workpiece are xr = xw = 0. Viscous damping is included between the
robot mass mr and the ground, between the workpiece mass mw and the ground, and between the
two masses, with positive coefficients br , bw , and bs , respectively. An input force F is applied on
the robot mass.

Solution
July 7, 2010
The differential equations of motion for the system are:
mr ẍr + br ẋr + bs (ẋr − ẋw ) + ks (xr − xw ) = F
mw ẍw + bw ẋw + bs (ẋw − ẋr ) + ks (xw − xr ) + kw xw = 0.

(1)

Setting F = kf (Fd − Fc ) = kf (Fd − ks (xr − xw )) and evaluating the system at an equilibrium (i.e.,
setting ẋr = ẋw = ẍr = ẍw = 0), gives
ks (xr − xw ) = kf (Fd − ks (xr − xw ))
ks (xw − xr ) + kw xw = 0.
It is easy to see that the unique solution is
xr.e =

ks + kw kf
Fd
ks kw 1 + kf

xw.e =

kf
1
Fd ,
kw 1 + kf

that provides also the contact force at the equilibrium
Fc,e = ks (xr,e − xw,e ) =

kf
Fd .
1 + kf

Therefore, there will be an error on the desired force given by
eF = Fd − Fc,e =

1
Fd .
1 + kf

This error can be reduced by amplifying the gain kf , but cannot be eliminated when using a simple
proportional controller. This situation typically asks for the introduction of an integral action of
the type
Z t
Z t
F = kf (Fd − Fc ) + ki
(Fd − Fc )dτ = kf (Fd − ks (xr − xw )) + ki
(Fd − ks (xr − xw ))dτ.

At steady-state (t → ∞), the argument of the integral term should vanish. Therefore,
Z t
lim
(Fd − ks (xr − xw ))dτ = constant ⇒
lim ks (xr − xw ) = Fd .

The modified equilibrium (denoted with a prime) will be
x0r.e =

ks + kw

x0w.e =

and the associated contact force will be desired one,

Fc,e
= ks (x0r,e − x0w,e ) = Fd ,

as expected. The same result is obtained if we combine the feedback control action with a constant
feedforward term Fd , i.e.
F = Fd + kf (Fd − Fc ).

The equilibrium configuration should satisfy then
ks (xr − xw ) = Fd + kf (Fd − ks (xr − xw ))
ks (xw − xr ) + kw xw = 0,
0
leading again to Fc,e
= Fd and the same previous positions x0r.e and x0w,e .

Indeed, no matter if we keep the proportional control law or add also the integral action or the
feedforward term, we need to show that the associated equilibrium is asymptotically stable for the
closed-loop system (otherwise it would never be reached from a generic initial state). Since the
system is linear, asymptotic stability is equivalent to exponential stability. Moreover, whenever it
holds, this result is global.
Considering again the case of a proportional force controller, the easiest way to prove asymptotic
stability of the closed-loop state xr = xr,e , xw = xw,e , ẋr = ẋw = 0 is to use Laplace transform
and the root locus method, thanks to the linearity of the system. From eq. (1) we have

mr s2 + (br + bs )s + ks Xr (s) = F (s) + (bs s + ks )Xw (s)

mw s2 + (bw + bs )s + (kw + ks ) Xw (s) = (bs s + ks )Xr (s),
where Xr (s), Xw (s), and F (s) are the Laplace transforms of xr (t), xw (t), and F (t). Defining for
compactness


Ns (s) = bs s + ks Dr (s) = mr s2 + (br + bs )s + ks
Dw (s) = mw s2 + (bw + bs )s + (kw + ks ) ,
we can solve for
Dw (s)
Xr (s)
=
F (s)
Dr (s)Dw (s) − Ns2 (s)

Xw (s)
Ns (s)
=
F (s)
Dr (s)Dw (s) − Ns2 (s)

Xw (s)
Ns (s)
=
.
Xr (s)
Dw (s)

Being the output defined as the contact force Fc (s) = ks (Xr (s) − Xw (s)), the transfer function of
the (open-loop) system is
P (s) =

Fc (s)
Dw (s) − Ns (s)
= ks
.
F (s)
Dr (s)Dw (s) − Ns2 (s)

Closing the feedback loop with F (s) = kf (Fd (s) − Fc (s)), where Fd (s) is the Laplace transform of
the step reference input Fd (t) = Fd · δ−1 (t), we obtain the transfer function
W (s) =

Fc (s)
kf P (s)
kf ks (Dw (s) − Ns (s))
=
=
.
Fd (s)
1 + kf P (s)
(Dr (s)Dw (s) − Ns2 (s)) + kf (ks (Dw (s) − Ns (s)))

Asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system depends on the location on the complex plane s of
the poles of W (s), i.e., of the roots of the polynomial equation

Dr (s)Dw (s) − Ns2 (s) + kf (ks (Dw (s) − Ns (s))) = A(s) + kf B(s) = 0.
(2)
By varying kf in (2), we can explore the root locus. For kf = 0, the (four) poles coincide with
the poles of the open-loop system P (s), i.e., with the roots of
A(s) = Dr (s)Dw (s) − Ns2 (s)
= mr mw s4 + ((bw + bs )mr + (br + bs )mw ) s3 + ((ks + kw )mr + ks mw + br bs + bs bw + br bw ) s2
+ ((br + bw )ks + (br + bs )kw ) s + ks kw = 0.

Applying the Routh criterion to the fourth-order polynomial A(s) and using the positivity of all
physical coefficients in (1), it is straightforward to check that the four poles of P (s) have all negative
real parts (the process itself is asymptotically stable). Moreover, by the standard rules of the root
locus, when kf is increased toward +∞, two of the closed-loop poles converge to the open-loop
zeros, i.e., to the roots of

B(s) = ks (Dw (s) − Ns (s)) = ks mw s2 + bw s + kw = 0,
which are in the left-hand side of the complex plane. The two other poles will approach the
asymptotes of the positive root locus, which are vertical (since the pole-zero excess of P (s) is
n − m = 2) and are located in the left-hand side of the complex plane s. As a result, the closedloop system is asymptotically stable for any value of kf ≥ 0.
Figure 2 shows the complete positive root locus obtained with Matlab, for some arbitrary
(positive) values of the model parameters, confirming the above analysis.

Indeed, the same asymptotic stability result could have been proven by applying the Routh
criterion to check the locations of roots of the whole polynomial on the left-hand side of (2) (but
this would have been more tedious).
