Table 1: Denavit-Hartenberg parameters of a 4R robot

1. Use the recursive algorithm based on moving frames to determine the kinetic energy of the
robot. Make reasonable assumptions in order to simplify the inertial properties of the links
(e.g., each link has a uniformly distributed mass, etc.)
2. Determine the robot inertia matrix. Find a minimal linear parameterization for this matrix.
