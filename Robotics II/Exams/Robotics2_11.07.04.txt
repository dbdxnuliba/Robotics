With reference to the scheme in Fig. 1, consider a one-dimensional force control problem in which
the robot is modeled as a mass m in contact with a compliant environment having mass mw ,
stiffness kw , and viscous damping dw . A control force u acts on the robot mass m. Let x1 and
x2 be the position of the robot mass and, respectively, of the environment mass. A force sensor
having stiffness ks is used to measure the contact force fc . All physical data can be assumed to be
positive.

We want to regulate the contact force to a constant positive value fd , by means of the following
control law:
u = kp (fd − fc ) + kf fd − kv ẋ1
(1)
where kp is a proportional feedback gain on the contact force error, kf is a force feedforward gain,
and kv is a gain on the robot mass velocity.
1. Derive the dynamic equations describing the robot-environment system when a generic force
input u is applied to the robot mass.
2. Draw a block diagram of the control scheme when using eq. (1) and write the associated
closed-loop equations.
3. Study the equilibrium configurations of the closed-loop system. In particular, choose suitable
(interval of) values for kp , kv , and kf such that the controlled system is asymptotically stable
and has a zero force error at steady state.
Optional: in this case, 60 minutes of additional time are available.
4. If feasible, perform a simulation with the resulting controller. For the simulation, use the following system parameters: m = 1 [kg], mw = 10 [kg], kw = 1000 [N/m], dw = 1000 [N·s/m],
ks = 100 [N/m]. The system is initially at rest and in equilibrium. The desired force has a
step variation of fd = 10 [N].
