Exercise 1
Consider the 3-dof planar robot in Fig. 1, with one prismatic and two revolute joints, moving in the
vertical plane. The coordinates q to be used are defined in the figure. Each link of the robot has uniformly
distributed mass mi > 0, i = 1, 2, 3, with center of mass on its physical link axis, and a purely diagonal
barycentric link inertia matrix. The prismatic joint range is limited as q2 ∈ [q2,min , q2,max ], with 0 <
q2,min < q2,max . The robot is commanded by a generalized vector of joint forces/torques τ ∈ R3 .
a) Derive the robot inertia matrix M (q) > 0.
b) Derive the gravity term g(q) and find all free equilibrium configurations of the robot.
c) Provide a linear parametrization of g(q) = Y g (q) ag , in terms of a vector ag ∈ Rp of unknown
dynamic coefficients and a 3 × p regressor matrix Y g (q). Assume that the gravity acceleration is
known, g0 = 9.81 [m/s2 ]. Discuss the minimality of p.
d) Determine which of the 9 non-zero inertia parameters of the three links are irrelevant for the describing
the motion of the robot.
e) Provide an upper bound α > 0 for the norm of the gradient of the gravity vector, k∂g(q)/∂qk < α for
all feasible q, expressed in terms of the dynamic parameters of the robot.

Exercise 2
Consider the same planar RPR robot as in Exercise 1. Assume that the robot can be commanded directly
by the generalized vector of joint velocities q̇ ∈ R3 defined in Fig. 1, thanks to a low-level control action
that guarantees their accurate reproduction. For a desired smooth motion of the end-effector position
p = pd (t) of its end-effector point P , provide the explicit expression of the instantaneous joint velocity
command that executes the Cartesian motion while minimizing 21 kq̇k2 . Modify this scheme in order to keep
possibly the prismatic joint close to the center of its limited range [q2,min , q2,max ], by using two alternative
methods: weighted pseudoinversion and projected gradient in the null space.

Exercise 3
With reference to Fig. 2, we consider a control problem for a mechanical system made by a first mass
mr > 0, representing the robot moved by a force F , and a second mass me > 0, anchored to a rigid wall by
a spring of stiffness ke > 0, representing as a whole a compliant dynamic environment. When in contact,
the two masses are connected by another spring of stiffness ks > 0, representing a force sensor. The
positional coordinates xr and xe of the two masses have their respective zero reference when the system
has no stored elastic energy, i.e., when there is no compression (nor extension) of the two springs. As a
result, the force measured by the sensor is Fs = ks (xr − xe ) ≥ 0, when xr ≥ xe (the robot is in contact),
or Fs = 0, when xr < xe (no contact).
We would like to regulate the contact force to a constant value Fd > 0 by means of four alternative
feedback/feedforward schemes F = Fi , i = 1, . . . , 4, defined as follows:
F1 = k1 (Fd − Fs ),

P control,

(1)

F2 = Fd + k2 (Fd − Fs ),
P +ffw control,
Z
F3 = k3 (Fd − Fs ) dt,
I control,
Z
F4 = Fd + k4 (Fd − Fs ) dt,
I+ffw control,

for suitable choices of ki > 0, i = 1, . . . , 4.
a) Determine the dynamic model of the open-loop system in the two situations xr (t) ≥ xe (t) (contact)
and xr (t) < xe (t) (no contact).
b) For each of the control laws (1) to (4), provide the equilibrium conditions of the closed-loop system in
terms of positions and contact forces. Which schemes satisfy zero force error at the equilibrium? Are
the equilibria unique in each case?
c) Is there any case in which a steady-state condition is not reached? Using any preferred analysis
technique (e.g., Lyapunov-based, or Routh criterion in the Laplace domain, or even qualitatively),
study the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop equilibria for at least two of the control laws.
d) Determine the initial motion of mass mr under the action of the different control laws, when starting
with xr (0) < xe (0) and with the system at rest. What problem would be encountered during the
non-contact phase and how could this be milden/resolved by the addition, when needed, of a damping
term −dv ẋr , dv > 0, in the control law?
