Exercise 1
Consider the Kawasaki S030 robot with six revolute joints and a spherical wrist shown in Fig. 1.
For every link mass mi , i = 1, . . . , 6, the location of the center of mass is shown graphically in the
different views (see also the distributed extra sheet in larger size; please, disregard any numerical
value therein). Note that the position of the center of mass of the fifth link (m5 ) as well as that of
the sixth link (m6 ) coincide with the wrist center —a simplifying assumption. The robot has been
calibrated and all kinematic quantities are thus known.
Determine the symbolic expression of the gravity vector g(q) ∈ R6 and a possible linear parametrization in terms of the unknown dynamic coefficients ag ∈ Rp , with the smallest value of p. Find all
equilibrium configurations q e of the robot (i.e., such that g(q e ) = 0).

Exercise 3
A robot with n > 3 joints, parametrized by q, is redundant w.r.t. a positional task x = f (q) of
dimension m = 2 or m = 3 (so, always with m < n), having task Jacobian J (q) = ∂f (q)/∂q.
At a configuration q̄ where rank J (q̄) = r < m, consider the following two cases of joint velocity
commands associated to a desired task velocity ẋd :
q̇ A = J # (q̄) ẋd ,

q̇ B = J T (q̄) ẋd .

Taking advantage of the Singular Value Decomposition of the matrix J̄ = J (q̄), show that:
i. In both cases, the actual ẋ can be different from the desired ẋd , but the vectors ẋd and ẋ make
always a relative angle that is smaller than π/2;

ii. When ẋd ∈ R J̄ , q̇ A gives no task velocity error, while q̇ B leads in general to an error
ė = ẋd − ẋ 6= 0.
Exercise 4
For a 2R robot moving on a horizontal plane, determine (in symbolic or numerical form) all terms
in the expression of a control law producing a joint torque τ ∈ R2 that is able to regulate the
robot end-effector position p ∈ R2 to a desired constant value pd , with a transient error e = pd − p
which globally satisfies, up to kinematic singularities, the differential equations

When starting at rest from an initial configuration q 0 that is not associated to pd , will the Cartesian
behavior of the robot end-effector be oscillatory during the transient?
Exercise 5
A robot should slide a cube, firmly held by its end-effector gripper, on a flat surface, following an
arbitrary path (see Fig. 2). For modeling purposes, assume that the surface is infinitely stiff and
frictionless.

Figure 2: A cube sliding along a path on a flat surface.
Provide the set of natural constraints and a suitable set of artificial constraints for this interaction
task with the environment. Consider both cases of a constant or arbitrary time-varying orientation
of the cube while moving along the path. How many control loops of the generalized force or motion
type are needed to achieve a perfectly linear and decoupled behavior in the task space? How many
degrees of freedom are necessary for the robot in order to fulfil all control specifications? Can at
least some of the desired control tasks be performed by a Scara robot? And by a 3R planar robot?
If so, under which conditions?

Solution
June 17, 2019
Exercise 1
We need to define first a set of generalized coordinates q, either by following a DH assignment of
frames or by direct inspection of Fig. 1. The latter is more convenient here. In fact, it is rather easy
to see that the definition of the link variables q1 and (q4 , q5 , q6 ) is irrelevant for the computation
of the gravity term g(q) in the robot dynamics because:
• the rotation q1 of joint 1 will not affect the height of the center of mass of any link;
• the position of the center of mass of link 4 will not depend on q4 , since m4 lies exactly on the
axis of joint 4;
• the position of the two center of masses m5 and m6 (which are assumed to be coincident1 with
the center of the spherical wrist) is independent from the joint variables of the wrist.
As a matter of fact, the potential energy of the system due to gravity, and thus the dynamic term
g(q), will be a function of q2 and q3 only. Moreover, we will have g1 = g4 = g5 = g6 ≡ 0 for the
components of g(q2 , q3 ).

Figure 3: One possible choice of variables q2 and q3 for the second and third links of the Kawasaki
robot, together with the definition kinematic/dynamic parameters.
With reference to Fig. 3, where the two joint variables q2 and q3 are defined (mimicking the classical
assignment for the planar 2R case), together with the kinematic/dynamic parameters l1 , dc2 , l2 ,
dc3 , dc4 and l5 , we obtain
U1 = constant,
1 This

U2 = m2 g0 (l1 + dc2 sin q2 ) ,

U3 = m3 g0 (l1 + l2 sin q2 + dc3 sin(q2 + q3 )) ,

simplifying assumption is a very strong one, in particular concerning the location of m6 .

U4 = m4 g0 (l1 + l2 sin q2 + dc4 sin(q2 + q3 )) ,

U5 + U6 = (m5 +m6 )g0 (l1 + l2 sin q2 + l5 sin(q2 + q3 )) .

As a result,

Ui = g0 (m2 dc2 + (m3 + m4 + m5 + m6 )l2 ) sin q2
+ g0 (m3 dc3 + m4 dc4 + (m5 + m6 )l5 ) sin(q2 + q3 ) + constants
= a1 sin q2 + a2 sin(q2 + q3 ) + constants.

.
Exercise 2
The given matrix M (q) is symmetric and does not depend on q1 —both are necessary conditions
for being the inertia matrix of a serial manipulator. In order to be a positive definite matrix, it is
necessary that all diagonal elements are strictly positive for all q. This implies
a1 > 0,

a4 + a5 > 2|a6 | > 0,

a5 > 0.

(2)

The necessary and sufficient condition for positive definiteness of a symmetric matrix (Sylvester
criterion) is that the leading minors are strictly positive (for all q). Under (2), this boils down in
checking that

(4)

M (q) is in fact the inertia matrix of the robot considered in the midterm test of Robotics 2 during the
academic year 2016/17, with some additional simplifying assumptions. As such, the conditions (4) are automatically
satisfied in that case by the explicit expressions of the dynamic coefficients.

Similarly, one can show that ẋTB ẋd ≥ 0. From the definition of the scalar products it follows that
ẋTd ẋA = kẋd k · kẋA k cos αA ≥ 0,

ẋTd ẋB = kẋd k · kẋB k cos αB ≥ 0.

Therefore, each of the obtained Cartesian velocities ẋA and ẋB will form an angle αi ≤ π/2,
i = A, B, with the desired ẋd .

Exercise 4
In order to achieve the desired linear and decoupled dynamics for the Cartesian error e = pd − p
at the end-effector level, the torque command τ in

τ = J T (q) (K P e − K D ṗ) ,

K P , K D > 0,

where ė = −ṗ being ṗd = 0. Rather, we should resort to a feedback linearization control law in
the Cartesian space. In the considered case of a square and (assumed) nonsingular robot Jacobian,
this law can be designed in two equivalent ways. Either by

by (6).
In order to study the characteristics of the transient behavior of the error e(t) → 0, one may
compute the roots of the following two algebraic equations in the Laplace domain:

2
s2 + 20s + 100 ex (s) = (s + 10) ex (s) = 0,

s2 + 10s + 50 ey (s) = (s + 5 − 5i) (s + 5 + 5i) ey (s) = 0.
As a result, when starting at rest with an initial ex (0) 6= 0, ex (t) will converge to zero without
overshoot (double negative real root), whereas ey (t) will converge to zero from an initial ey (0) 6= 0

always changing its sign during the transient (a pair of complex conjugate roots, with negative real
part). See the numerical example in Fig. 4.
Exercise 5
With reference to the task frame (xt , y t , z t ) shown in Fig. 5, the six natural constraints on the
task are:
vz = 0, ωx = 0, ωy = 0, Fx = 0, Fy = 0, Mz = 0.
The six complementary artificial constraints specify the way in which the interaction task should
be executed:
Fz = Fz,d < 0,

Mx = Mx,d = 0,

My = My,d = 0,

vx = vx,d ,

vy = vy,d ,

ωz = ωz,d .

Here, |Fz,d | =
6 0 is the intensity of the normal force to the plane that the robot should apply to
the cube so as to keep one of its faces in permanent contact. The desired moments around the
axes xt and y t are both set to zero, so as to minimize the actual strain
on the cube. The desired
q

2 + v2
trajectory on the plane will be followed with a scalar speed ṡ = vx,d
y,d > 0. Finally, the
choice of either a constant or arbitrary time-varying orientation of the cube while moving along
the path is made by setting either ωz,d = 0 or, respectively, ωz,d = ωz,d (t).

Figure 5: The instantaneous task frame associated to the cube moving on a flat surface.
As a result, in a hybrid force-velocity formulation, there will be three control loops on the generalized force components and three control loops on the planar motion components. Out of
singularities, hybrid force-velocity control will achieve a perfectly linear and decoupled behavior of

8

these six controlled outputs associated to the task space. In general, a robot with six degrees of
freedom will be necessary in order to fulfil all control specifications.
With a Scara-type robot (four parallel joint axes, three revolute joints providing motion on a plane
and a prismatic joint acting orthogonally), only four control specifications can be satisfied. If
the joint axes of the robot are (perfectly) normal to the plane of motion of the cube, then the
remaining two specifications Mx,d = My,d = 0 are automatically satisfied (although any desired
value different from zero for these quantities could not be realized).
When using a 3R planar robot (with all revolute joint axes normal to the plane of motion of the
cube), the task specification of a non-zero normal force along the axis z t cannot be accomplished.
The dofs of this robot are instead necessary and sufficient to execute a complete planar motion,
with arbitrary values of vx,d , vy,d and ωz,d .
