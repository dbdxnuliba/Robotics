Exercise 1
Let the dynamics of a robot manipulator with n joints be described by the usual Lagrangian model
(neglecting dissipative terms):
M (q)q̈ + c(q, q̇) + g(q) = τ .

(1)

• List all feedback control laws for τ that allow regulation to a desired (generic) constant
configuration q d . For each control law, specify the design conditions that guarantee success,
the type of convergence/stability achieved, and the pros and cons of the method.
• When applied to eq. (1), is it possible that the control law
τ = K P (q d − q) − K D q̇

(2)

achieves asymptotic stabilization of a desired state (q, q̇) = (q d , 0)? If so, under which
operative conditions? Would these conditions be only sufficient or also necessary?
• Can it happen that the following control law applied to eq. (1)
τ = g(q d ) + K P (q d − q) − K D q̇

(3)

does not achieve asymptotic stabilization of the state (q, q̇) = (q d , 0)? Why (or why not)?
What should be done in (3) to validate the reverse statement “does certainly achieve . . . ”?
Exercise 2
• In the context of image-based visual servoing (IBVS), determine the interaction matrix
J p,polar associated to a point feature s = (ρ θ)T ∈ R2 which is parametrized with polar
coordinates in the image plane, i.e.,

where λ > 0 is the focal length of the camera, Z > 0 is the depth coordinate of the Cartesian
point P = (X, Y, Z) in the camera frame, and the perspective equations of a pinhole camera
model are used.
• Discuss the characteristics of the obtained interaction matrix in terms of decoupled effects
on the chosen feature parameters, when only single components of the linear velocity V ∈ R3
or of the angular velocity Ω ∈ R3 are active. Compare this analysis with the one on the
interaction matrix J p that uses the Cartesian coordinates (u, v) in the image plane.
• In an IBVS control law that regulates the polar coordinates of a point feature s to a desired
constant value sd , what careful actions may be needed when the point P is on or gets close
to the optical axis of the camera?

Exercise 3
Consider the planar PRP robot in Fig. 1, moving under gravity. Its dynamic model can be written
in the form
Y M (q, q̇, q̈) aM + g(q) = τ ,
(4)
where the inertial terms and the related Coriolis and centrifugal components are already expressed
in a linear factorized form in terms of the dynamic coefficients aM ∈ RpM . In the following, assume
that the symbolic expressions of Y M and aM are known.
• Derive explicitly the gravity term g(q) and an associated minimal factorization in the form
g(q) = Y g (q) ag , with ag ∈ Rpg .
• Provide the expression of an adaptive control law that guarantees global asymptotic tracking
of a desired joint trajectory q d (t) ∈ C 2 , without any a priori knowledge of the numerical
values of the robot dynamic parameters. How many states will have this dynamical controller?
• Assume now that the actual values of the dynamic coefficients aM are known in advance.
Solve the previously stated trajectory tracking problem by designing an adaptive controller
that has a reduced number of states. Sketch a formal proof of your result.

of a metallic work piece.
Exercise 4
Consider a robotized polishing task of a large surface area of a metallic work piece, as shown in
Fig. 2. The work piece has a complex geometry, with planar and curved surfaces. The polishing
tool held by the robot ends with a sphere which is in point-wise contact with the geometric surface
of the work piece. The tool needs not to be orthogonal to the local tangent plane to the surface.
However, in order to complete an optimal polishing (reducing the roughness of the surface below
a specified level —with tolerances in the order of few µm), a specified normal force should be
applied to the surface while moving the tool in contact with an assigned constant speed. Assume a
perfectly rigid interaction and that friction at the contact can be neglected in this modeling stage.
Define a task frame in which the polishing operation can be correctly defined and executed. Specify
accordingly the natural and artificial constraints. Sketch the task frame in two cases, on a flat
surface of the work piece and on a curved one.

Solution
May 29, 2017
Exercise 1
The first part is a free text exercise. Completeness, accuracy, and clarity in writing are evaluated.
For the two other specific questions:
• The control law (2) achieves asymptotic stabilization of a desired state (q, q̇) = (q d , 0) also in
the presence of gravity if: i) g(q d ) = 0 (the desired configuration is an unforced equilibrium
for the open-loop system); ii) K P is symmetric and positive definite, and its minimum
eigenvalue K P,m > α, where α > 0 is a global upper bound on the norm of the Hessian of
the potential energy Ug (q) due to gravity; iii) K D is symmetric and positive definite. In
general, these are only sufficient conditions.
• Even assuming that K P and K D are symmetric and positive definite, the control law (3)
may still fail because K P,m ≤ α. Indeed, when this sufficient condition is violated, we cannot
predict if we will obtain asymptotic stabilization of the desired equilibrium state or not.

Comparing now the structural zeros of J p (u, v, λ, Z) and J p,polar (ρ, θ, λ, Z), we see that in the first
case the effects of Vx and Vy respectively on u̇ and v̇ are decoupled, whereas in the second case the
decoupled effects of Vz and Ωz are respectively on ρ̇ and θ̇.
Finally, when the 3D Cartesian point P is sufficiently close to the optical axis (ρ → 0), matrix J t
becomes ill-conditioned, meaning that small motions of the Cartesian point may then lead to huge
variations of the chosen polar parameters —in particular of θ— in the image plane. To recover a
regular behavior close to and across ρ = 0, the inverse of J t may be replaced, for instance, by a
damped least squares matrix with damping factor σ 2 > 0,

Exercise 3
We compute first the gravitational potential energy Ug (q) = U1 + U2 + U3 , with
U1 = 0,

U2 = m2 g0 d2 sin q2 ,

U3 = m3 g0 (q3 + d3 ) sin q2 .

with pg = dim(ag ) = 2. The dynamic model (4) can thus be rewritten as

Y M (q, q̇, q̈) aM + Y g (q) ag = Y M (q, q̇, q̈) Y g (q)
= Y (q, q̇, q̈) a = τ .
ag
Note that the linear parametrization of the dynamic model by a may not be minimal, since there
could be some overlapping between the coefficients in aM and those defined in ag .
Assuming that the values of all dynamic coefficients a are unknown, the adaptive trajectory tracking control takes the usual form
τ = Y (q, q̇, q̇ r , q̈ r )â + K P (q d − q) + K D (q̇ d − q̇),

The number of states of the adaptive controller (5), i.e., the number of its defining differential
equations, is equal to the number of updating dynamic coefficients: dim(â) = pM + pg = pM + 2.
Assuming that the values of the dynamic coefficients aM are already known, one can define an
adaptive trajectory control with the same global tracking properties of (5), but with a reduced
number of states equal to pg = 2. In fact, it is natural to define this controller as
τ = Y M (q, q̇, q̇ r , q̈ r )aM + Y g (q)âg + K P (q d − q) + K D (q̇ d − q̇),

where q̇ r = q̇ d + Λ(q d − q), Λ > 0, and Y g (q)âg = ĝ(q).
The proof of global asymptotic stability of the tracking error follows the same lines of the proof
holding for (5). The ‘trick’ in (6) that leads to this sufficient result stands in preserving the
passivity structure also in the known term: namely, adopting q̇ r and q̈ r in the evaluation of Y M
(and not q̇ only (or q̇ d ) and q̈ d ), as well as using the skew-symmetric property of a suitable
factorization c(q, q̇) = C(q, q̇)q̇ of the Coriolis and centrifugal terms. More in detail, take the

Exercise 4
With reference to Fig. 3, the task frame is placed at the contact point between the spherical
tool and the surface. The z t -axis is always aligned with the downward normal to the surface, no
matter if the surface is locally flat or curved. One of the two other axes, say xt , can be chosen
to be aligned with the desired polishing direction on the metallic surface. Remember that, in the
modeling phase, the tool-surface contact is assumed to be rigid and frictionless. Therefore, the
spherical tool can also slide without rolling in contact. Moreover, being the contact point-wise,
there cannot be any moment applied by the tool at the contact.

According to the chosen task frame, the natural (geometric) constraints of this interaction problem
are
vz = 0, Fx = 0, Fy = 0, Mx = 0, My = 0, Mz = 0,
while the artificial constraints are
Fz = Fz,d > 0,

vx = vx,d > 0,

vy = vy,d = 0,

ωx = ωx,d ,

ωy = ωy,d ,

ωz = ωz,d .

Therefore, a hybrid force-motion controller designed based on feedback linearization and decoupling
will include five scalar position control loops and only one force control loop. The value vy,d = 0
is related to the choice of the xt -axis being aligned with the tangent to the polishing path, which
is executed at the speed vx,d , that should be followed on the surface. Moreover, when there is no
need to change the orientation of the tool (e.g., for avoiding collision with some lateral side of the
T
work piece), we set ω d = ωx,d ωy,d ωz,d
= 0. Finally, the positive value Fz,d specifies the
normal force needed for obtaining a satisfactory polishing result (by pressure).
