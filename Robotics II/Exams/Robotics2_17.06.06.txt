Exercise 1
The direct kinematics of the planar 3R robot with unitary link lengths using absolute coordinates (i.e.,
the link angles w.r.t. the x-axis) is
!
c1 + c2 + c3
p = p(q) =

The third-order differential kinematics, including the second time-derivative J̈ of the Jacobian, is

When the initial conditions of the robot are perfectly matched with the desired end-effector trajectory,
p(q(0)) = pd (0),

J (q(0)) q̇(0) = ṗd (0),

J (q(0)) q̈(0) + J̇ (q(0)) q̇(0) = p̈d (0),

(3)

the nominal solution for executing pd (t) with minimum norm of the joint jerk is (dropping dependencies)

...
q = J # p d − 2J̇ q̈ − J̈ q̇ .

From (1), we have

It is easy to find an initial configuration q 0 = q(0) that is matched with the initial position of the trajectory:

p(q 0 ) = pd (0).

Instead, when the initial conditions of the robot are not matched with the desired end-effector trajectory
(i.e., if one or more of the identities in (3) is violated), in order to obtain exponential tracking of pd (t),
the solution with minimum norm of the joint jerk can be modified as (dropping dependencies)

...
q = J # p d + k2 p̈d − J q̈ − J̇ q̇ + k1 (ṗd − J q̇) + k0 (pd − p) − 2J̇ q̈ − J̈ q̇ ,
(5)
where the scalars k0 , k1 , and k2 are such that
k(s) = s3 + k2 s2 + k1 s + k0
is a Hurwitz polynomial, namely it has all roots in the left-hand side of the complex plane. From Routh
criterion, this happens if and only if
k0 > 0,

k1 >

k0
> 0,
k2

k2 > 0.

To show the transient properties of the control law (5), let the Cartesian position error be defined as
e = pd − p ∈ R2 . From
“
”
... ...
... ...
...
e = p d − p = p d − J q + 2J̇ q̈ + J̈ q̇
using (5) and being JJ # = I 2×2 , it is easy to see that the following linear differential equation holds:
...
e + k2 ë + k1 ė + k0 e = 0.
Under the conditions (6), the evolution of e(t) and of its time derivatives is that of the modes of an
asymptotically stable linear system, namely exponentially or pseudo-exponentially converging to zero.

Exercise 2
We compute first the gravitational potential energy Ug (q) = U1 + U2 + U3 . We have
U1 = m1 g0 d1 sin q1 ,

U2 = m2 g0 (`1 sin q1 + d2 sin q2 ) ,

U3 = m3 g0 (`1 sin q1 + `2 sin q2 + d3 sin q3 ) .

Using the expressions of p(q) and J (q) from Exercise 1 and the mass data, we evaluate the control law (2)
`
´T
with K P = kP · I 2×2 , at the initial time t = 0, when q(0) = π/2 0 0
and q̇(0) = 0:

kp > 0, g0 = 9.81 > 0.

Therefore, the largest value kp > 0 that satisfies the bounds on the joint torques, |τi | ≤ Tmax = 300 Nm,
for i = 1, 2, 3, is the one that saturates the second torque component, i.e.,
τ2 (0) = kp + 15g0 = 300 [Nm]

⇒

kp = 300 − 15g0 ' 152.85.

If K P = diag{kP x , kP y } and all the rest is as before, the control law (2) is evaluated again as

τ (0) = J T (q(0)) diag{kP x , kP y } (pd − p(q(0))) + g(q(0)) = @ kP y + 15g0 A ,

kP x > 0, kP y > 0.

(8)

kP y + 5g0
Therefore, we can take as the largest gain values those that saturate the first two components of the torque
τ , i.e.,
kP x = τ1 (0) = 300 [Nm],
kP y = 300 − 15g0 ' 152.85 [Nm].
In both cases, the value of K D = kD · I 2×2 does not play any role (as long as q̇ = 0).
Finally, consider the case of torque bounds in the form |τθ,i | ≤ Tmax = 300 Nm, for i = 1, 2, 3, where
τ θ are the torques producing work on the relative coordinates θ (of the Denavit-Hartenberg convention).

Note also that, from the linear transformations (9), a feasible cube of side 2Tmax = 600 Nm centered in
the origin of the τ θ -space becomes a skewed parallelepiped in the τ -space (and vice versa).
Exercise 3
Following a Lagrangian approach, we compute first the kinetic energy T (q, q̇) = T1 + T2 + T3 . We have
´
`
T1 = 12 m1 q̇12 ,
T2 = 21 m2 q̇12 + d2 q̇22 − 2d sin q2 q̇1 q̇2 + 12 I2 q̇22 ,
