• Derive the expression of the reduced robot dynamics (in this case, a single first-order differential equation), written in terms of pseudoacceleration and automatically satisfying the
constraint. Try to provide global validity to this model.
• Design a control law that regulates to constant desired values vd and λd , respectively the
tangent velocity and the normal force to the end-effector constraint.

Solution
February 6, 2013
Following the Lagrangian approach for a robot with N , with multipliers λ used to weigh the M dimensional holonomic constraints h(q) = 0, the dynamic equations (in the absence of gravity)
take the form
B(q)q̈ + c(q, q̇) = u + AT(q)λ
s.t. h(q) = 0,
(1)
with A(q) = ∂h(q)/∂q.
The reduced dynamic model is obtained by restricting the motion to a R-dimensional configuration space, with R = N − M , that is automatically compatible with the constraints h(q) = 0.
The constraints are thus discarded from the formulation. At the same time, it is also possible to
eliminate the appearance of the multipliers (i.e., of the forces that arise when attempting to violate
the constraints) in the resulting dynamic equations.
We provide first the terms that appear in (1), namely the robot inertia matrix B, the Coriolis
and centrifugal vector c, and the matrix A. The kinetic energy1 is

h(q) = q2 cos q1 − k = 0.

The reduction of the dynamics proceeds then as follows. In the present case, it is N = 2 and
M = 1, so that R = 1. Define the matrix D(q) (a row in our case) such that

1 For simplicity, it is assumed that the first link has its center of mass on the axis of the first joint. Otherwise, if
the center of mass is at a distance dc1 , simply replace I1 by I1 + m1 d2c1 in the following.

Since the end-effector is constrained to live on x = k > 0, it will always be q2 6= 0. Thus, the
requested non-singularity of the matrix holds globally as long as the constraint is enforced. This
implies that the following derivations will lead also to a globally defined reduced model.
Define then the pseudovelocity v (a scalar) and its derivative v̇ (the pseudoacceleration) as
v = D(q)q̇ = q2 cos q1 q̇1 + sin q1 q̇2 ,
v̇ = D(q)q̈ + Ḋ(q)q̇ = q2 cos q1 q̈1 + sin q1 q̈2 − q2 sin q1 q̇12 + 2 cos q1 q̇1 q̇2 .
To invert these relations, define

Based on their definitions, the matrix relations AF = O and AE = I hold for all q. Premultiplying (1) by F T (q) and substituting the acceleration q̈ from (2) yields

F T (q)B(q)F (q) v̇ = F T (q) u − B(q)Ḟ (q)v − c(q, q̇) ,

which is the reduced dynamics that we were looking for —in fact, a scalar first-order differential
equation in v. All terms in (3) have been defined, but we can write more explicitly the leading
scalar (a pseudoinertia)

Similarly, by premultiplying (1) by E T (q) (a row) we can isolate the scalar multiplier λ. Substituting the acceleration q̈ from (2) yields


λ = E T (q) B(q)F (q)v̇ + B(q)Ḟ (q)v + c(q, q̇) − u .
(4)
The control task is defined at the end-effector level, and requires the stabilization to zero of
the error ev = vd − v for the tangential velocity and of the error eλ = λd − λ for the normal force.

The tangential and normal directions are indeed referred to the geometry of the constraint. This
hybrid control task is easily achieved in a linear and decoupled way by using a preliminary feedback
linearization law for the joint-space control input u ∈ R2 . Defining in eqs. (3) and (4)
u = B(q)Ḟ (q)v + c(q, q̇) + B(q)F (q)u1 − AT (q)u2
leads simultaneously to
v̇ = u1 ,

λ = u2 .

The control design is completed by choosing

u1 = k1 ev ,

u2 = λd + k2

with k1 > 0, k2 > 0. Beside the feedforward term (λd in the force loop, while v̇d = 0 in the velocity
loop for constant desired velocity), we have respectively a proportional action on the velocity error
and an integral action on the force error. The two error dynamics will be
Z
ėv + k1 ev = 0,
eλ + k2 eλ = 0,
both exponentially converging to zero.
