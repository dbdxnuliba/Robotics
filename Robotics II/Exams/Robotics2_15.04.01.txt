Exercise 1
Consider the planar RP in Fig. 1, moving in the vertical plane. The center of mass of the first
link lies always on the axis of the revolute joint. In the following, use the generalized coordinates
q = (q1 , q2 ) defined in this figure.

a) Determine all equilibrium configurations q 0 = (q01 , q02 ) for the open-loop system.
b) Derive the linearized model equations, obtained by a first-order Taylor expansion around an
equilibrium x = (q, q̇) = (q 0 , 0) = x0 , expressed in the state-space format ẋ = Ax + Bu,
where u is the vector of generalized joint forces provided by the actuators.
c) Design a regulation controller that globally asymptotically stabilizes any desired state of the
form x0 = (q 0 , 0) in the closed-loop system, specifying all model terms in the control law.
d) What kind of behavior can be inferred locally around the desired state for the obtained
closed-loop system, using the linearized model as in step b)?
Exercise 2

Figure 2: A planar 3R robot moving among obstacles
The 3R robot shown in Fig. 2 has equal links of unitary length and is redundant for all tasks
defined only in terms of the position of its end effector in the plane. The robot should move its
end-effector toward the goal, while avoiding to collide with the obstacles in its workspace. Discuss
the use of redundancy for the specific configuration shown in the figure, illustrating also graphically
the instantaneous velocities imposed to the robot structure by the goal attraction and the repulsion
from the obstacle(s).
