Exercise 1
For link i, i = 1, 2, 3, let mi be its mass and Ii its inertia around an axis normal to the plane of
motion and passing through the center of mass. Moreover, for i = 1 and i = 3, di is the distance
of the center of mass of link i from the axis of joint i, while for the second link, d2 will denote the
(constant) distance of its center of mass from the axis of joint 3 —see Fig. 3.

To derive the robot dynamic model terms, we follow a Lagrangian approach. For obtaining the
inertia matrix B(q), we compute the kinetic energy T = T1 + T2 + T3 of the three robot links. For
the first link, it is

T1 = (I1 + m1 d21 ) q̇12 .

take into account the following identities (for β = π/2): cos(q1 + π/2) = − sin q1 , sin(q1 + π/2) = cos q1 .

b12 (q3 ) = (m2 + m3 )`1 − m3 d3 sin q3 = π3 `1 − π4 sin q3
b13 (q2 , q3 ) = I3 + m3 d23 + m3 d3 (q2 cos q3 − `1 sin q3 ) = π5 + π4 (q2 cos q3 − `1 sin q3 )

(3)

b22 = m2 + m3 = π3
b23 (q3 ) = −m3 d3 sin q3 = −π4 sin q3
b33 = I3 + m3 d23 = π5 .
In the expressions (3) of the elements of B(q), we have assumed that the kinematic parameter
`1 is known and found thus a linear parameterization in terms of five dynamic coefficients πi ,
i = 1, . . . , 5.
For obtaining the vector g(q), we compute the potential energy U = U1 + U2 + U3 due to gravity
for the three robot links. Using the expressions of the y-component of the vectors pci , i = 1, 2, 3
(see also eqs. (1) and (2)), we have
U1 (q1 ) = m1 g0 pc1,y = m1 g0 d1 sin q1
U2 (q1 , q2 ) = m2 g0 pc2,y = m2 g0 (`1 sin q1 + (q2 − d2 ) cos q1 )
U3 (q1 , q2 , q3 ) = m3 g0 pc3,y = m3 g0 (`1 sin q1 + q2 cos q1 + d3 cos(q1 + q3 )) .

Solving for g(q 0 ) = 0 provides all equilibrium configurations q 0 . From the second component
in (4), it follows that q0,1 = ±π/2, which confirms also the intuition that the prismatic joint
axis should be horizontal at the equilibrium. Plugging this into the third equation leads again
to q0,3 = ±π/2. Imposing these two conditions in the first equation, g1 (q 0 ) = 0 provided the
additional condition q2 = m2 d2 /(m2 + m3 ). Thus, all unforced equilibrium configurations for this

which are nonlinear due to the cubic terms in the deformation δ = q − θ of the spring.
For the equilibrium conditions, we set θ̈ = q̈ = 0 in eqs. (5)–(6). From the second one, we obtain
the following algebraic equation:
kn (q − θ)3 + k(q − θ) − mg0 = 0.
This is a cubic equation of the form

(8)

(depressed) cubic equation in (7) was studied already in the XVI century. The formula (8) is attributed to
the mathematician Gerolamo Cardano, but in fact is due to Scipione del Ferro and Niccolò Fontana (also known as
Tartaglia).

Therefore, for a given desired position q = q̄ of the mass m, we compute from (8) the spring
deformation δ̄ at steady state and set
θ̄ = q̄ − δ̄.
(9)
Moreover, from eq. (5) at steady state we obtain the required input force
ū = k(θ̄ − q̄) + kn (θ̄ − q̄)3 = k δ̄ + kn δ̄ 3 = −mg0 .

(10)

The input force balances the weight of the mass m, as reflected through the elastic force τe of the
deformed spring. Note that that the mass b plays no role in this analysis.
Using now the given numerical data, and in particular q̄ = 0.1, k = 1000, kn = 10000 and m = 3,
we compute
δ = 0.0292,
θ̄ = 0.0708,
ū = −29.4300.
(11)
As a result, the static deformation of the nonlinear spring at the equilibrium is equal to slightly
less than 3 cm. The deformation-force characteristics τe = kδ + kn δ 3 of the chosen spring is shown
in Fig. 4, where we have indicated also the actual deformation δ̄ at equilibrium. In correspondence
to this value, we can easily check that the elastic force is τe = −ū.
