Exercise 1
The 3R planar robot in Fig. 1 is commanded at the joint velocity level. The robot has to perform two
tasks simultaneously, if possible. The first task is to keep the second link vertical and upwards at any time.
The second task is to follow a desired cyclic Cartesian trajectory pd (t) ∈ R2 , t ∈ [0, T ], for the end-effector
position. Provide the actual expressions of all terms in a task priority control law, with the given order
of tasks. Determine the robot configurations for which both tasks can be perfectly executed together, and
define accordingly the region of the plane where this can happen. Which would be the control law in this
case? With link lengths L1 = L2 = L3 = 0.5 [m], compute the numerical value of q̇ ∈ R3 using the task

Exercise 2
The RP planar robot shown in Fig. 2 lives in a vertical plane and may collide with some (human) obstacle
when in motion. Its controller is therefore equipped with a momentum-based collision detection algorithm
that generates a residual vector r ∈ R2 as monitoring signal. Provide the explicit symbolic expressions
of the two scalar components of r (introduce the needed kinematic and/or dynamic quantities). Suppose
that, at time t = tc , a collision occurs on the robot tip with an impact force F c that is purely normal to
the second link. What will be the instantaneous value of the time derivative of the residual vector ṙ(tc )?

Exercise 3
An actuated pendulum under gravity should perform a rest-to-rest swing-up maneuver from the downward
position θ(0) = 0 to the upward position θ(T ) = π in a total time T , using a bang-coast-bang acceleration
profile with symmetric acceleration and deceleration phases, each of duration Ts = T /4. The link of
the pendulum is a thin rod of length l = 2 [m], with uniformly distributed mass m = 10 [kg] and
baricentral inertia Ic = ml2 /12 [kg·m2 ]. The motor at the link base can deliver a maximum absolute
torque τmax = 200 [Nm]. Determine the minimum time Tmin in the chosen class of trajectories such that
the motion is feasible. Sketch the resulting angular position, velocity, acceleration, and torque profiles.

Exercise 1
We will use throughout the DH coordinates indicated in Fig. 2. The first task, i.e., keeping the second link
vertical and upwards, is one-dimensional (m1 = 1) and is specified by

While the first two columns of the matrix in (3) are always dependent, it is easy to see that its rank is
full unless sin(q2 + q3 ) = 0. With the joint velocity command (2), the first task will always be satisfied if
the constraint f1 (q) = π/2 holds at the start, whereas the second task will be satisfied either exactly or
in a least squares sense, depending on the current robot configuration and on the direction of the desired
velocity ṗd .
In order to verify when both tasks can be achieved simultaneously, we impose q1 (t) + q2 (t) ≡ π/2 at all
times. From the direct kinematics of the robot tip p = f 2 (q), one obtains then the reduced form
!
L1 c1 − L3 s3
pred = f 2 (q)|q1 +q2 =π/2 =

As a result, the robot will be able to generate also any desired ṗred = ṗd ∈ R2 , provided that

The actual region of the plane where the two tasks can be performed simultaneously is illustrated in Fig. 3
for some specific but arbitrary values of the link lengths. The second link is always kept vertical and
upwards. The circular annulus has outer radius Rout , inner radius Rin , and center CWS on the axis y 0 ,
computed by simple geometric reasoning as
Rout =

(L1 + L2 + L3 ) − (−L1 + L2 − L3 )
= L1 + L3 ,

Rin = Rout − 2L3 = |L1 − L3 | ,

and

(L1 + L2 + L3 ) + (−L1 + L2 − L3 )
= L2 .

For L1 = L2 = L3 = L, this is a full circle (Rin = 0) of radius Rout = 2L, centered at CWS = L on axis y 0 .

As mentioned, when q1 + q2 = π/2 and (4) hold, then the TP method (2) will generate the exact (and
unique) solution for both tasks. In these conditions, the same solution is obtained with q̇ red = J −1
red (q red )ṗd
and q̇2 = −q̇red,1 . Equivalently, because of the assumed consistency of the two tasks, the problem can be
solved also by the Extended Jacobian method (since n = m1 + m2 = 3):

We have in fact det J E (q) = −L1 L3 sin(q2 + q3 ). So, when the second link is kept vertical and upwards
(q1 + q2 = π/2), the two singularities of the Extended Jacobian matrix (q2 + q3 = {0, π}) correspond
exactly to having q3 = q1 ± π/2, i.e., the violation of condition (4).

On the other hand, when the robot is in the requested configuration q 0 = 0 π/2 −π/2

tasks are inconsistent (condition (4) is violated). In this situation, the robot end effector is on the outer
boundary of the Cartesian region of compatibility, and the desired tip velocity points outside. The task

by introducing an error feedback term in both tasks as

with a scalar gain k1 > 0 and a (typically, diagonal) matrix gain K 2 > 0. Since J 1 q̇ c = k1 e1 , we always
have ė1 = −k1 e1 and the error on the first task will exponentially converge to zero. On the other hand,
the control law (6) will generate the largest possible reduction (or, in the worst case, the smallest increase)
of the error on the second task, without ever affecting the first task.

Suppose now that, at time t = tc , a collision force F c acts at the robot tip in the orthogonal direction
to the second link and with an intensity F 6= 0 (see again Fig. 5). The Jacobian J c (q) associated to the
contact point and the contact force are then

From the nominal behavior of the residual vector r, being r(t) = 0 for all t ∈ [0, tc ], it follows that
(
ṙ1 (tc ) = kI1 F (tc ) q2 (tc )
ṙ(tc ) = K I (τ c (tc ) − r(tc ))
⇒
ṙ2 (tc ) = 0.
Although the collision occurs on the second link, the second component of the residual will not be affected
immediately; in fact, F c is not producing work on q2 , due to the specific direction assumed for the impact
force.
Exercise 3
The acceleration profile for the rest-to-rest motion trajectory θ(t) is assigned to be of the bang-coast-bang
type, having symmetric initial and final acceleration/deceleration phases, each of duration Ts = T /4 and
with θ̈ = ±A, and a cruising phase that lasts for half of the motion time, i.e., T /2, with constant velocity
θ̇ = V . From this motion structure, it is easy to compute the following quantities:

(13)
3T 2

The swing-up maneuver from θ(0) = 0 to ∆θ = θ(T ) = π in time T needs then an acceleration/deceleration
A = ±16π/(3T 2 ) in the first and third motion phases. Note that, when the acceleration phase ends
at time t = Ts = T /4, the performed motion will be ∆θs = ∆θ/6 = π/6. By symmetry, when the
deceleration phase begins at time t = T − Ts = 3T /4, the performed motion completed so far will be
∆θ − ∆θs = 5∆θ/6 = 5π/6.
With the above in mind, consider the dynamics of the actuated pendulum

By inverse dynamics on (14), the torque needed to perform the desired motion during the three phases is:


−IA + mg0 d sin θ(t),
θ ∈ [π/6, π],
phase III: t ∈ [3T /4, T ].
The gravity contribution to the inverse dynamics torque is maximum at the midpoint of motion, i.e., at
θ = π/2, is independent of the total motion time, and is equal to τg = mg0 d < τmax . Note that if it
were τg > τmax , then actuation would be too weak to perform the intended task (even when moving the
pendulum very slowly, with an arbitrarily long motion time T ).
Further, from (13) and (15) it is easy to see that, when speeding up motion by uniformly reducing T , the
inertial torque component in the first phase will increase quadratically and the maximum required torque
will be attained at the end of the first phase, where the gravity contribution is the largest (and has the
same sign of the acceleration). Thus, for feasibility we require that

motion is indeed τmax = 200 [Nm], reached at the single instant t = Tmin /4 = 0.3041 [s]. Accordingly, we
obtain from (13) A = 11.3212 [rad/s2 ] and V = 3.4432 [rad/s]. Figure 6 shows the resulting time profiles
