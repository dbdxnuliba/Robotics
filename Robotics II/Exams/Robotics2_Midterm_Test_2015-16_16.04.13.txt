shown in the figure.

Exercise 2
The 4R planar robot in Fig. 2 moves under gravity. For each link, the center of mass lies on its longitudinal
axis of symmetry, at a generic distance from the driving joint. Determine: i) the expression of the gravity
vector g(q) in the robot dynamic model; ii) all equilibrium configurations of the robot (i.e., all q e such that
g(q e ) = 0; iii) a linear parametrization of the gravity vector in the form g(q) = Y G (q)aG ; the particular
location of the center of masses of the links such that the gravity vector vanishes (i.e., g(q) = 0, for all q).

Exercise 3
The 4R planar robot with all links of equal length ` in Fig. 3 needs to realize a motion task defined by
a desired linear velocity v d for its end-effector position pe and by a desired angular velocity φ̇d for the
orientation φ of its end-effector frame. Characterize first all the singular configurations of the robot for
this specific task.
Assume then ` = 0.5 [m], q = (0 0 π/2 0), v d = (1 0) [m/s], and φ̇d = 0.5 [rad/s]. Moreover, the joints have
limited motion range, i.e., qi ∈ [−2, 2] [rad], for i = 1, . . . , 4. Determine the joint velocity q̇ that realizes
the desired task while decreasing instantaneously the objective function that measures the distance from
the midpoint of the joint ranges, i.e., in the form
Hrange (q) =

Exercise 1
Since the motion is planar, we will use two-dimensional position and velocity vectors (in the (x0 , y 0 )
plane) and just the z-component of angular velocities. Also, the usual shorthand notation is adopted for
trigonometric quantities, e.g., s2 = sin q2 , c23 = cos(q2 + q3 ).
Kinetic energy
For link 1, we have (the position of the center of mass on link 1, i.e., d1 , is irrelevant)
T1 =

1
m1 q̇12 .
2

For link 2, we compute first the position of the center of mass and its velocity,
!

q1 + d2 c2

v c2 =

d2 s2
d2 c2 q̇2
and then
kv c2 k2 = q̇12 + d22 q̇22 − 2d2 s2 q̇1 q̇2 .
Since ω2z = q̇2 , we obtain
T2 =

`
´ 1
1
m2 q̇12 + d22 q̇22 − 2d2 s2 q̇1 q̇2 + I2 q̇22 .

Similarly, for link 3
pc3 =

q1 + `2 c2 + d3 c23
`2 s2 + d3 s23

!
→

v c3 =

q̇1 − `2 s2 q̇2 − d3 s23 (q̇2 + q̇3 )
`2 c2 q̇2 + d3 c23 (q̇2 + q̇3 )

!
,

and then
kv c3 k2 = q̇12 + `22 q̇22 + d3 (q̇2 + q̇3 )2 − 2`2 s2 q̇1 q̇2 − 2d3 s23 q̇1 (q̇2 + q̇3 ) + 2`2 d3 (s2 s23 + c2 c23 ) q̇2 (q̇2 + q̇3 ).
Being ω3z = q̇2 + q̇3 , we obtain (after trigonometric simplification)
T3 =

`
´ 1

m3 q̇12 + `22 q̇22 + d3 (q̇2 + q̇3 )2 − 2`2 s2 q̇1 q̇2 − 2d3 s23 q̇1 (q̇2 + q̇3 ) + 2`2 d3 c3 q̇2 (q̇2 + q̇3 ) + I3 (q̇2 + q̇3 )2 .

Exercise 2
Again, the robot motion occurs in a (vertical) plane and we will use for simplicity two-dimensional position
vectors in the plane (x0 , y 0 ). The total potential energy is
U=

X

Ui ,

Ui = −mi g T r 0,ci ,

i=1

4

i = 1, . . . , 4.

Since
`
´
g T = 0 −g0 0 ,
g0 = 9.81 [m/s2 ],
we need to compute only the y-component of the position vector r 0,ci of the center of mass of the link i,
for i = 1, . . . , 4. We have
r0,c1,y = d1 s1
r0,c2,y = `1 s1 + d2 s12
r0,c3,y = `1 s1 + `2 s12 + d3 s123
r0,c4,y = `1 s1 + `2 s12 + `3 s123 + d4 s1234 ,
where di is the (signed) distance of the center of mass of link i from the axis of joint i (i = 1, . . . , 4). Thus
U = g0 m1 d1 s1 + g0 m2 (`1 s1 + d2 s12 ) + g0 m3 (`1 s1 + `2 s12 + d3 s123 ) + g0 m4 (`1 s1 + `2 s12 + `3 s123 + d4 s1234 )

=: aG1 s1 + aG2 s12 + aG3 s123 + aG4 s1234 ,
where we have introduced the dynamic coefficients aGi (i = 1, . . . , 4) for the constant factors related to
gravity.

All equilibrium configurations q e are found by analyzing recursively the vector equation g(q e ) = 0 from
the last component backwards:
g4 (q e ) = 0

→

c1234 = 0

g3 (q e ) = 0

→

being already c1234 = 0

g2 (q e ) = 0

→

being already c1234 = 0, c123 = 0

g1 (q e ) = 0

→

being already c1234 = 0, c123 = 0, c12 = 0

→

c123 = 0
→

c12 = 0
→

c1 = 0.

Thus, the unforced equilibria of the robot (assuming a generic mass distribution) are characterized by
π
qe1 = ± ∩ qe2 = {0, π} ∩ qe3 = {0, π} ∩ qe4 = {0, π} ,
2
namely with the robot being stretched or folded along the vertical direction only.
Finally, perfect balancing in all configurations (i.e., g(q) = 0) is obtained for when the mass distribution
zeroes the vector of dynamic coefficients, namely aG = 0. Starting again from the last component and
proceeding backwards, we obtain
aG4 = 0

→

d4 = 0

where the square matrix T is clearly nonsingular. Thus, J and J a have always the same rank. In particular,
the Jacobian J will be full (row) rank if and only if the 2 × 3 upper left block of matrix J a will have rank
equal to 2. This matrix block corresponds to the well-known Jacobian of a planar 3R robot (with equal
links of length `) performing a positional task with its end-effector. The singularities of the 4R arm for
the given task occur then if and only if
