Exercise #1
The PR robot in Fig. 1 moves on a horizontal plane. Its positive definite inertia matrix has the
form

Using only the symbolic coefficients a, b and c in (1), provide the expression of the regressor matrix
Y (q, q̇, q̇ r , q̈ r ) in the adaptive control law that guarantees global asymptotic tracking of a smooth
joint trajectory q d (t), without a priori information on the values of the dynamic coefficients.

Exercise #2
For the same PR robot in Fig. 1, suppose that a desired twice-differentiable trajectory yd (t) ∈ R has
been assigned to the coordinate y of the end-effector position. With the robot in the configuration
T
q̄ = 1 π/2
and at rest, provide the three input vectors of joint force/torque τ A , τ B , and τ C
(all ∈ R2 ) that execute the desired task and instantaneously minimize, respectively,

Which of the three solutions has the largest component at the first joint in absolute value?
Exercise #3
Assume now that the robot in Fig. 1 is moving instead in a vertical plane. Derive the expression
of the gravity term g(q) in the dynamic model as a function of the robot dynamic parameters m1 ,
m2 , dc2 and I2 . In order to regulate the robot configuration at a desired constant value q d , the
following control law is being applied:
τ = K P (q d − q) − K D q̇ + g(q d ).

(2)

Provide explicit sufficient conditions (depending also on the robot dynamic parameters) ensuring
that the law (2) globally asymptotically stabilizes the closed-loop equilibrium state (q, q̇) = (q d , 0).

Exercise #4
Consider the task of rolling a sphere of radius R on a rigid plane, while the contact point C follows
a desired trajectory on the planar surface. The sphere will be held by a robot through a gimbal
fork that allows free rotation of the sphere around the instantaneous direction of the axis r —see
Fig. 2. In turn, the fork can be rotated around the axis t, which remains however always vertical.
Under the action of a sufficiently large force in the normal direction to the plane, friction at the
contact will let the sphere only roll when in motion, without slipping. With this in mind, define
a suitable task frame and specify the natural and artificial constraints associated to this hybrid
T
∈ R6
force-velocity control problem. How many generalized velocity directions V = v T ω T
can be independently assigned by the control law?
