Huge portal robots are used in the aeronautical industry for moving and reorienting large surface
plates of aircraft bodies. Figure 1 shows a subassembly of one such robots, having three actuated
joints and three passive joints (shown in different colors).

Figure 1: A portal robot used in the aeronautic industry
Two vertical bars of height H are placed at a distance D. Along the vertical bars, two actuated
prismatic joints (with variables q1 ∈ [0, H] and q2 ∈ [0, H]) are used to modify the position and
the orientation of a connecting bar in the vertical plane (x0 , z 0 ). The two passive revolute joints,
placed at a distance d << D from the vertical bars, transform the linear motion of q1 and q2
in a linear and/or angular motion of the connecting bar. The passive prismatic joint along the
connecting bar accommodates itself so that the bar changes length consistently with the positions
q1 and q2 . Furthermore, the connecting bar can be rotated by an actuated revolute joint (with
angle q3 ) along its main geometric axis. The available actuating force/torque u = (F1 , F2 , τ3 )
performs work on the generalized coordinates q = (q1 , q2 , q3 ). From an operational point of view,
curved plates of the aircraft body are placed and fixed on the connecting bar. Then, the motion of
the portal robot can change the orientation of the normals to the plate surface to be worked (e.g.,
for riveting).
Figure 1 shows also the location of the center of masses of the three main moving bodies (of
masses m1 , m2 , and m3 ) of the portal robot. The following assumptions are made.
• The mechanism associated to the passive prismatic joint is such that the center of mass of
the connecting bar is always kept on the vertical line passing through the center of the portal
(i.e., at x0 = D/2), despite the extension or retraction of the connecting bar itself.
• The connecting bar has a diagonal inertia matrix
b

I b = diag {Ix , Iy , Iz } ,
1

with Iy = Iz

when expressed in a frame (xb , y b , z b ) attached to the bar, with origin at its center of mass
and principal axes along its geometric axes of symmetry.
• The values of the scalar inertias Ix and Iy = Iz change with the length of the connecting bar.
Since the distance D is much larger than the actual excursion of q1 and q2 , this effect can be
neglected if needed. In this case, for dynamic modeling purposes the bar will be considered
of constant length D − 2d (as when it is horizontal or close to this situation).
With the above description in mind, and considering the previous assumptions:
1. Derive the dynamic model of this portal robot using the generalized coordinates q in a
Lagrangian approach.
2. Define the simplest control law for u that is able to regulate the robot to a desired constant equilibrium state (q, q̇) = (q d , 0), defining conditions on the control parameters that
guarantee global asymptotic stability.
3. Bonus, or in alternative to 2. Show that q = (q1 , q2 , q3 ) is in fact a set of generalized
coordinates for this robot, which has the structure of a closed kinematic chain (closed through
the floor). In particular, show that the values of the angular position of the two passive
revolute joints and the extension of the connecting bar thanks to the presence of the passive
prismatic joint can be uniquely obtained from the values of q1 , q2 , and q3 .

Solution
July 5, 2012
Following the Lagrangian approach, we compute the kinetic energy and the potential energy due
to gravity for the robot bodies based on the generalized coordinates q = (q1 , q2 , q3 ).
The kinetic energy for the first two bodies (moving only up and down) is simply
T1 =

1
m1 q̇12 ,
2

T2 =

1
m2 q̇22 .

For the third body (the connecting bar), it is useful to introduce the variable

that represents the angle of the bar w.r.t. to the horizontal (positive counterclockwise around the
axis y 0 ). For evaluating the linear contribution to the kinetic energy of this bar
T3,l =

m3 v Tc3 v c3 ,

we compute the position of its center of mass and then differentiate w.r.t. time:

it will be convenient to work in the frame (xb , y b , z b ) attached to the center of mass and having
the xb along the principal direction of the bar (rotated thus w.r.t. x0 by the angle α around y 0 ),
in which the inertia matrix is diagonal. Note that this frame has y b aligned with y 0 when q3 = 0.
Its absolute orientation is expressed by the rotation matrix

We will first compute the angular velocity 0 ω 3 , expressed in the base frame, by superposition of
the contributions of q̇1 , q̇2 , and q̇3 (just as in the derivation of the geometric Jacobian). Consider
the single contribution of q̇1 , while q̇2 = q̇3 = 0. When the coordinate q1 moves (say, upward,
3

i.e., with q̇1 > 0), the same linear velocity is applied to the left end of the connecting bar. This
can be decomposed in a velocity component along the bar, which will slightly extend it, and a
velocity component along the normal to the bar, which is responsible for its rotation (clockwise
when looking at the structure from the front side, and thus counterclockwise when seen from y 0 ).
When the bar is tilted by α, the resulting angular velocity contribution due to q̇1 will be

being δ the actual length of the connecting bar. Indeed, as mentioned in the text, we could neglect
the (small) contribution by (q1 − q2 )2 and have simply δ = D − 2d > 0. Proceeding in the general
case, the following relation holds from trigonometry:

The same argument can be used for the contribution of q̇2 , except that an opposite sign will result.
Adding also the contribution of q̇3 to 0 ω 3 , we obtain finally

We note that only the (symmetric) matrix term B 00 of the positive definite robot inertia matrix is
configuration dependent (and depends only on the difference q1 − q2 ).

and where we used the specular dependence of b on q1 and q2 . Similarly, it is easy to see that

Accordingly, c = 0 would follow (no Coriolis and centrifugal terms).
We turn now to the computation of the potential energy due to gravity, U (q) = U1 + U2 + U3 .
T
For this, since 0 g = 0 0 −g0
with g0 = 9.81 [m/s2 ], we just need to evaluate the height of
the centers of masses. Thus
U1 = m1 g0 q1 ,
U2 = m2 g0 q2 ,
while, in view of the assumption on the position of the center of mass of the connecting bar,
U3 = m3 g0

The gravity term is constant, and so ∂g/∂q = 0.
Summarizing, in the general case the robot dynamic model takes the form
B(q)q̈ + c(q, q̇) + g = u,

(11)

with inertia matrix, Coriolis and centrifugal term, and gravity term given respectively by eqs. (6),
(7), and (10). In the reduced case, the dynamic model simplifies to
B q̈ + g = u,
6

(12)

with constant inertia matrix given by (9) and gravity term as in (10). The dynamic equations (12)
are fully linear.
In order to solve the regulation problem for a desired equilibrium state (q, q̇) = (q d , 0) as
requested, we can use a decentralized PD control law with constant compensation of gravity (which
is anyway constant for all configurations!). Therefore, we have


kp1 (qd,1 − q1 ) − kd1 q̇1 + g1





u = K p (q d − q) − K d q̇ + g =  kp2 (qd,2 − q2 ) − kd2 q̇2 + g2  .

(13)

kp3 (qd,3 − q3 ) − kd3 q̇3
Since the Hessian of the gravitational potential energy is identically zero, there will be no strictly
positive lower bound for the (diagonal) elements of K p in this control law: in order to guarantee
global asymptotic stability, the sufficient conditions for the control gains are only K p > 0 and
K d > 0. Note that this applies to both dynamic models (11) and (12). The only difference is that
for (12), global exponential stability will be further obtained since the system dynamics is linear.
In this case, the following simple modification of (13)
u = B (K p (q d − q) − K d q̇) + g,
i.e., with non-diagonal but still constant PD gains BK p and BK d , will also provide a fully
decoupled dynamics of the joint errors in the closed-loop system.
For the bonus (or alternative to the above) question, consider the sketch in Fig. 2 where, beside
the variables q1 , q2 and q3 related to the actuated joints, we have assigned also variables β and γ to
the two passive revolute joints1 , and δ to the passive prismatic joint. The purpose of our analysis is
to show that the set of variables (β, γ, δ) can always be expressed as a function of (q1 , q2 ) —this is
similar to what we have already shown in eq. (1) for the angle α. Therefore, the robot configuration
can be fully described by the minimal set (q1 , q2 , q3 ), which is indeed the chosen set of configuration
variables used for the Lagrangian dynamics. Because the closed kinematic chain lies always in the
plane (x0 , z 0 ), the variable q3 plays no role in the analysis, and will then no longer be considered.

relation (3). Moreover, squaring and adding the two equations in (16) yields

δ = (q1 − q2 )2 + (D − 2d)2 > 0,
which is the variable already defined in (2). Finally, dividing the second equation in (16) by the
first one, we obtain

tan α =

recovering thus the original expression for α introduced in (1).
