Exercise 1
For the RPP cylindrical robot in Fig. 1, using the generalized coordinates defined therein, provide the
symbolic expression of each term of the dynamic model that appears in the control law
τ = M (q)q̈ d + C(q, q̇)q̇ d + g(q) + K P (q d − q) + K D (q̇ d − q̇) ,

K P > 0,

K D > 0,

(1)

so that global asymptotic tracking of a desired joint trajectory q d (t) ∈ C 2 is guaranteed. Joint axis 3 has
a DH offset a2 6= 0 from joint axis 2. Moreover, the center of mass of links 1 and 3 is placed on the joint
axis having the same index, while the center of mass of link 2 is at a distance r2 > 0 from joint axis 2.

Exercise 2
Consider a Cartesian robot moving in a vertical place and having its end effector constrained to an ideal
(rigid, frictionless) linear surface tilted by an acute angle α > 0 from the x-axis, as in Fig. 2. For this
robot in constrained motion, provide the explicit symbolic expressions of
• the reduced dynamics, i.e., the differential equation relating the pseudo-acceleration v̇ ∈ R to the
pseudo-velocity v ∈ R, the configuration q ∈ R2 , and the input forces at the joints u ∈ R2 ;
• the multiplier λ ∈ R, i.e., the scalar reaction force that would act on the robot end effector when
attempting to violate the geometric constraint.
Is it possible, by a suitable choice of u, to realize a uniform motion with constant velocity v = V on the
surface, while inducing no reaction force, i.e., with λ = 0? If so, when and how?

Exercise 3
Consider a planar 3R robot, with equal link lengths ` = 0.4 m and equal, uniformly distributed link masses
m = 2.5 kg, that moves in a vertical plane. The generalized coordinates q ∈ R3 are defined by a standard
Denavit-Hartenberg convention. Under the action of the Cartesian control law (with gravity cancelation)

where pd = 1.17 0.2 , K P = 400 · I 2×2 , K D = 40 · I 2×2 , and p(q) is the direct kinematics of the
end-effector position, the robot has reached the equilibrium condition shown in Fig. 3, in which the first
link is in contact with a rigid obstacle. In this steady state, determine the numerical values of
• the control torque τ ∈ R3 at the joints;
• the joint torque τ c ∈ R3 at the joints due to the contact force F c ∈ R2 acting on the first link;
• the momentum-based residual r ∈ R3 for collision detection/isolation, when K I = 10 · I 3×3 ;
• if possible, the components of the contact force F c acting on the first link (expressed in frame RF0
or in frame RF1 ).

In order to guarantee global asymptotic trajectory tracking for the control law (1), the factorization
c(q, q̇) = C(q, q̇)q̇ of the Coriolis and centrifugal terms should be such that Ṁ − 2C is a skew-symmetric
matrix. This is automatically guaranteed if the components of the Coriolis and centrifugal vector c(q, q̇)
are computed using the Christoffel’s symbols, i.e.,

The dynamic model of the PP robot constrained to the surface becomes

⇐⇒

sin α , the force multiplier is given by
⇐⇒

λ = −m1 cos α sin α v̇ − (m1 + m2 )g0 cos α + u1 cos α − u2 sin α. (8)

Note that for α = π/2, equations (7–8) collapse to
(m1 + m2 ) v̇ + (m1 + m2 )g0 = u1 ,

λ = −u2 ,

showing in particular that each force applied by the second actuator will result in an equal reaction force
in the opposite direction.
Finally, it is possible to maintain a uniform motion with constant velocity v = V on the linear surface
without having a reaction force λ = 0 at all times, under following (necessary and sufficient) conditions:
• the robot is in an initial configuration q 0 satisfying h(q 0 ) = 0, i.e., the end effector is already on the
linear surface;
• the robot has an initial velocity q̇ 0 satisfying Aq̇ 0 = 0 and such that kṙ 0 k = V or

The unknown contact force F c generates a joint torque τ c = J Tc F c , which will have a non-zero component τc1 only at joint 1, the only joint preceding the contact point. Moreover, because gravity is being
compensated by control (and thus removed from this analysis) and the robot is in a static equilibrium,
from the balance of joint torques it follows that



Note that the internal structure of r supports its isolation property: in fact, the components of r associated
to joints that are beyond the contacting link are always zero. This is true not only at steady state, but
also in dynamic conditions, when the robot is moving and may hit an obstacle.
At this stage, knowing exactly the contact point on link 1, we can recover at least the component n Fc of the
contact force F c that is normal to the first link. Instead, the internal force component t Fc that is aligned
with link 1 produces no torque at joint 1, and thus cannot be reconstructed from τc1 only. Expressing the
contact force in the frame RF1 rotated with link 1, we have
