Exercise 1
The Justin upper-body robot by DLR (Fig. 1) is made of a 3-dof torso (with coordinates q T ∈ R3 ),
carrying two identical 7-dof structures as left (q L ∈ R7 ) and right (q R ∈ R7 ) arms. Neglecting the
T
anthropomorphic hands, there is a total of 17 joints (all revolute), with q = q TT q TL q TR ∈ R17 .
Let the desired Cartesian motion (in position and orientation) of the end-effectors of the left and
right robot arms be independently specified as r L,d (t) ∈ R6 and r R,d (t) ∈ R6 , respectively.

• Define a kinematic control law for the joint velocity q̇ of the robot that is able to accomplish
the whole task, recovering also from any possible initial errors at the Cartesian level.
• Is it possible to shape the joint solution so that motion of the torso is reduced (i.e., most
of the task is executed by the two arms only)? And by blocking completely the dofs of the
torso? Discuss qualitatively the nature of possible singularities that can be encountered with
the proposed control strategies, and how to avoid them or milden their effects.
Exercise 2
The 3R robot in Fig. 2 is placed on a horizontal plane. The three links have unitary length,
uniform mass distribution, and their masses are m1 , m2 , and m3 . With the robot at rest, a force
F is applied to the tip as illustrated.

• Will the robot end effector accelerate like in case A, B, or C? Motivate your answer.
• Determine the symbolic expression of the end-effector acceleration p̈ in terms of the dynamic
coefficients of the robot model.
• By considering a special distribution of link masses and inertias, would it be possible to
obtain an end-effector acceleration like in case D? Motivate your answer.
