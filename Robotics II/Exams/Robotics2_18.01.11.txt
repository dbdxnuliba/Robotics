Assume that:
• the main shaft has an inertia Is around its rotation axis
• the two balls have identical mass m that is concentrated at the end of a link of length L
• the links and all other linkages have negligible masses
• a viscous friction torque with coefficient fv > 0 is acting on the main shaft
• all other frictional effects are negligible.
Derive the complete dynamic model of this system using a Lagrangian formalism. Assuming
knowledge of the geometric parameter L, provide a linear parametrization of the dynamics in
terms of its dynamic coefficients. Find the value of the constant torque τΩ to be applied for
sustaining a steady-state rotation at a given angular speed Ω > 0. Finally, design a nonlinear
feedback for τ so as to achieve partial feedback linearization of the system, i.e., exact linearization
by feedback of only part of the closed-loop dynamics, in this case of one of the two coordinates.
Exercise 3
Consider the design of impedance control laws and force control laws for the 1-dof example, shown
in Fig. 3, namely a single mass m that moves on a frictionless horizontal plane under the action of
a commanded force f ∈ R and of a contact force fc ∈ R.

Figure 3: A mass m subject to a commanded force f and a contact force fc .
In particular:
• The impedance controllers should work with a generic time-varying, smooth position reference
xd (t), either with or without the use of a load cell that can measure the contact force fc .
Illustrate the properties of the obtained closed-loop systems.
• What happens when xd (t) degenerates to a constant? What happens during free motion,
when fc = 0?
• For m = 5 [kg], design the control parameters of the impedance law so that the dynamics
of the position error e = xd − x in the closed-loop system is characterized by a pair of
asymptotically stable complex poles with natural frequency ωn = 10 [rad/s] and critical
damping ratio ζ = 0.7071.
• On the other hand, the force controllers should be able to regulate the (measured) contact
force fc to a constant value fd , using any combination of desired force feedforward and force
error feedback. Illustrate the properties of the obtained closed-loop systems.
• What happens during free motion, when fc = 0 and a constant contact force fd is desired?

Solution
January 11, 2018
Exercise 1
The problem deals with kinematic redundancy since the RP robot has n = 2 joints and the required
task is scalar m = 1. The task output function and its Jacobian are
y(q) = q2 sin q1 ,

J (q) =

∂y(q)
=
∂q

q2 cos q1

sin q1



.

(1)

The 1 × 2 task Jacobian loses rank (vanishes) iff q1 = {0, π} and q2 = 0 simultaneously.
The minimization of the squared norm of q̇ is achieved by the use of the pseudoinverse of the
task Jacobian. Out of singularities, J # = J T (J J T )−1 and the kinematic control law takes the
expression


q2 c1

#
(ẏd + k(yd − q2 sin q1 )) ,
(2)
q̇ = J (q) (ẏd + k(yd − y(q))) = 2
s1 + q22 c21
s1
where k > 0 is a control gain that guarantees exponential recovery from transient errors, i.e.,
ė(t) = −ke(t), with e = yd − q2 sin q1 6= 0, during task execution. The pitfall of (2) is that
the norm kq̇k involves mixed angular (the revolute joint velocity q̇1 ) and linear (the prismatic
joint velocity q̇2 ) quantities, so its straight minimization is ill-defined conceptually. In fact, the
denominator in (2) contains the sum of an non-dimensional term (s21 ) and of a term with (squared)
length units. Stated differently, changing the representing units (e.g., from 1 m to 100 cm) will
change the ‘optimal’ solution.
The minimization of the weighted norm 12 q̇ T W q̇, leading to weighted pseudoinversion of the task
Jacobian, may solve this theoretical issue. In particular, the units of the (positive) elements in
the diagonal of W can be used to make terms non-dimensional (e.g., by choosing w1 in (squared)
−1 T
length units). Out of singularities, J #
J (J W −1 J T )−1 and the kinematic control law
W = W
takes the expression

with k > 0 as before. Indeed, different values of the weights w1 and w2 will lead to different joint
velocity solutions. It is easy to verify that is the relative ratio between w1 and w2 that really
matters. For very large ratios w1 /w2 , the cost of moving the (revolute) joint 1 will be dominant
and therefore the solution (3) will tend to minimize its motion while performing the task. In the
limit, when w1 → ∞, it follows from (3) that q̇1 → 0, while q̇2 ∝ 1/s1 : therefore, executing the task
will become more and more problematic as the second link gets closer to the horizontal. Similarly,
for w2 /w1 → ∞ the second (prismatic) joint will be very expensive to move, while q̇1 ∝ 1/q2 c1 :
the control effort will increase dramatically when the second link is close to being vertical (c1 ' 0)
and/or fully retracted (q2 ' 0).
For the third objective, we need first to derive the inertia matrix of the RP robot. From the
expression of the kinetic energy T = T1 + T2 , with

(4)

The minimization of the kinetic energy T is then a special case of a weighted pseudoinversion of
the task Jacobian, with one weight being configuration dependent. Thus, out of singularities, the
inertia-weighted kinematic control law takes the expression
 q2 c1 
q̇ = J #
M (q) (ẏd + k(yd − y(q))) =

Note that the two addends in the first denominator have both consistent units of [kg−1 ].
Exercise 2
Let q = (θ, φ). Following a Lagrangian approach, under the given assumptions, we compute the
kinetic energy T = Ts + 2Tm for the main shaft and the two equal balls. We have

with the vector π ∈ R3 of dynamic coefficients.
In a steady-state equilibrium with constant angular velocity θ̇ = Ω > 0, we have θ̈ = 0 and
φ̈ = φ̇ = 0. This yields from (9)
τΩ = fv Ω,

L sin φ cos φ Ω2 + g0 sin φ = 0

⇒

cos φe =

(11)

The input torque τΩ has to compensate just for the energy loss due to friction, in order to keep a
uniform motion via constant angular velocity. Moreover, the equilibrium angle φe results from the
balance of the gravity force and the centrifugal force. Its value increases (in the range (0, π/2))
together with Ω.
Finally, by applying the nonlinear feedback law

τ = Is + 2mL2 sin2 φ a + 4mL2 sin φ cos φ θ̇ φ̇ + fv θ̇

The dynamics of θ is now exactly linear (a double integrator), while partial control of the motion of

Exercise 3
The dynamic equation of the system in Fig. 3 is

(14)

Impedance control. The so-called inverse dynamics control law becomes in this simple case
f = ma − fc ,

(15)

and transforms system (14) into the double integrator
ẍ = a.

(16)

The auxiliary input a has to be designed so that the controlled mass m, under the action of the
contact force fc , matches the behavior of an impedance model characterized by a desired (apparent)
mass md > 0, desired damping kd > 0, and desired stiffness kp > 0, all acting with respect to a
smooth motion reference xd (t), or
md (ẍ − ẍd ) + kd (ẋ − ẋd ) + kp (x − xd ) = fc .

(17)

Equating ẍ in (16) and in the reference behavior (17), solving for a and substituting in (15) yields

The feedback law (18) requires in general a measure of the contact force fc .

In the reference model (17), the position error e = xd − x does not converge to zero if there is
a contact force fc . Otherwise, e will asymptotically go to zero —indeed exponentially, in view of
the linearity of the system dynamics. In particular, for kd2 < 4kp md , the obtained second-order
linear system (17) is characterized by a pair of asymptotically stable complex poles with natural
frequency and damping ratio given by
r
kp
kd

ζ= p
.
(19)
ωn =
md
2 kp md
Reducing the desired mass md , for given values of stiffness and damping, will increase both the
natural frequency ωn and the damping ratio ζ, and thus improve transients. On the other hand,
for a given mass md , an increase of the stiffness kp should be accompanied by an increase of
the damping kd in order to prevent more oscillatory transients. If the desired mass equals the
natural (original) mass, i.e., md = m, a measure of the contact force fc is no longer needed in the
impedance controller (18).

Wishing to achieve ωn = 10 and ζ = 0.7071 = 1/ 2, equations (19) provide

for any md > 0.

kp = 100 md ,
kd = 10 2 md ,
Being m = 5 [kg], if we take in particular md = m = 5, we obtain as gains
√
kp = 500,
kd = 50 2 = 70.71,

(21)

and a measure of fc will not be needed.
In regulation tasks (with xd (t) = xd = constant), by choosing again md = m, the control law 18)
collapses to just a PD action on the position error e,
f = kp (xd − x) − kd ẋ.

(22)

This scheme is also called compliance control, since the main design parameter left is the desired
stiffness kp . Also in this case, the system will converge to x = xd if (and only if) there is no contact
force. With fc 6= 0 but constant, the position xe 6= xd that satisfies
kp (xd − xe ) + fc = 0

⇒

xe = xd +

fc
kp

(23)

will be an asyptotically (exponentially) stable closed-loop equilibrium, as can be possibly checked
with the Lyapunov candidate V = 21 mẋ2 + 21 kp (x − xe )2 ≥ 0 (using in this case LaSalle theorem
for the analysis).
Force control. If we desire to regulate explicitly the contact force to a desired constant value fd ,
it is necessary to build a force error ef = fd − fc into the control law. After using (15), define the
auxiliary input a as
1
a=
(kf (fd − fc ) − kd ẋ) ,
(24)
md
with force error gain kf > 0 and velocity damping coefficient kd > 0. The associated control force
is then
m
f=
(kf (fd − fc ) − kd ẋ) − fc .
(25)
md
A contact force measure is needed in this case, even if we choose md = m. The closed-loop system
becomes
md ẍ + kd ẋ = kf (fd − fc ).
(26)
6

During free motion, i.e., as long as fc = 0, the mass will eventually move at the constant speed
ẋe = kf fd /kd . Therefore, the gain kd can be tuned so as to keep this speed low (say, during an
approaching phase before contacting a hard environment).
An analysis of the general behavior of system (26) for fc 6= 0 is impossible without assigning a
model that describes the source of the contact force fc . Even if we can measure it, as assumed
when designing (25), we do not know the evolution of this disturbance nor can impose a desired
behavior to it. Should the force error ef converge to zero at steady state, it follows from eq. (26)
that also the mass velocity ẋ would go to zero. However, the position xe reached at the equilibrium
would depend on the actual history of the external contact force (see an example in Appendix).
Assume then that contact forces are generated by a compliant environment with stiffness kc > 0,
placed beyond the (undeformed) position x = xc > 0. Then, the model for the reaction force of
the environment is
(
−kc (x − xc ),
for x ≥ xc ,
fe =
(27)

else.
During contact, the force applied to the mass is fc = −fe . Thus, from (26) and (27) it follows
md ẍ + kd ẋ = kf (fd − kc (x − xc ))

⇒

md ẍ + kd ẋ + kf kc x = kf (fd + kc xc ) .

(28)

The steady-state position reached by the second-order asymptotically stable system (28) in response
to the (positive) step input kf (fd + kc xc ) and the associated steady-state contact force will be
xe = xc +

fd
kc

⇒



fc = −fe = kc (xe − xc ) = fd .

(29)

A slight variant of the force control law (25) is obtained by replacing the cancelation of the actual
contact force in (15) by a compensation/feedforward of the desired contact force, i.e., f = ma − fd .
Using again (24), we obtain
f=

m
(kf (fd − fc ) − kd ẋ) − fd ,

(30)

and, as a result, the closed-loop system

It is immediate to see that the analysis of (32) can be completed as for (28), provided that the
slightly more restrictive design condition kf > md /m > 0 is satisfied. Under this hypothesis, the
steady-state conditions for the asymptotically stable system (32) are the same given in (29).

Appendix (extra material to Exercise 3)
Consider a scheme for the contact force generation modeled by
f˙c = α(fd − fc ),

with α > 0,

(33)

and assume, e.g., fc (0) = fc0 > fd (the initial contact force is larger than the one desired). Then
fc (t) = fd − (fd − fc0 ) exp−αt

and ef (t) = fd − fc (t) = (fd − fc0 ) exp−αt = ef 0 exp−αt . (34)

Assuming x(0) = ẋ(0) = 0 and discarding the special case α = kd /md , the solution of (26) can be
found by Laplace techniques and is given by the following position trajectory
