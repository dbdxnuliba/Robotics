Robotics  2

Remote  Exam  –  July  15,  2020

Consider the 4-dof robot in Fig. 1, made by a 3R planar arm mounted on a rail.  
The robot has
the  last  three  links  of  equal  length  `.   The  generalized  coordinates  
q      R4   to  be  used  are  also
shown.  Determine the inertia matrix M (q) of the dynamic model of this robot 
(if needed, define
symbolically any missing parameters).

parameters.

Exercise  #2

For the same robot in Fig. 1, assume ` = h = 1 [m] and consider the following 
tasks, to be executed
using a kinematic control scheme with joint velocity commands q˙  ∈ R4.

Task  1.  Trace  with  the  end-effector  counterclockwise  a  circle  of  
radius  R =  3  [m],  centered  at

C = (7, 0), starting from point P ₀ = (10, 0) and with constant speed v = 1 
[m/s].

Task  2.  Keep the second link always horizontal (q₂(t) = 0).

Define  the  augmented  Jacobian  JA(q)  for  both  tasks  1  and  2.   Choose  
a  suitable  initial  robot
configuration  so  as  to  stay  at  time  t =  0  in  P ₀  and  compute  there 
 the  minimum  joint  velocity
norm solution that realizes both tasks simultaneously.  Determine the first 
point P s on the circular
path where an algorithmic singularity of JA(q) necessarily occurs.  In that 
situation, compute the
minimum joint velocity norm solution that realizes the first task only.  Will 
the execution of the
second task be relaxed or not?

Exercise  #3

A 6-dof robot should hold firmly with its three-fingered gripper a cylindric 
payload, and move it
along a desired path on a frictionless plane with one of its bases in full 
contact with the plane, as
shown in Fig. 2.  Define an associated task frame where the natural (geometric) 
constraints and
the artificial (control) constraints of this hybrid task can be defined and 
realized in a decoupled
way.  Where reasonable, provide also values for the control references.

planar surface.


Exercise  #4

During  the  accurate  execution  of  a  smooth  joint  trajectory  qd(t)  
lasting  T  =  3  [s]  with  the  2R
planar robot shown in Fig. 3 moving under gravity, the maximum torques of the 
two joints exceed
at some instants their bounds, as given by |τi| ≤ τmₐₓ,i, i = 1, 2.  We have in 
particular

τ₁(t₁) =  max  τ₁(t) = 140 > 100 = τmₐₓ,₁,       τ₂(t₂) =  max  τ₂(t) = 25 > 20 
= τmₐₓ,₂        [Nm].

t∈[0,T ]                                                                        
                            t∈[0,T ]

The robot links have equal length ` = 0.5 [m] and equal, uniformly distributed 
mass m = 5 [kg].

The robot configurations at the time instants t = t₁ and t = t₂ are

q(t ) =   π/4    0  T ,           q(t ) =   −π/4    3π/4  T           [rad].

In  order  to  recover  motion  feasibility,  a  uniform  trajectory  scaling  
is  used.   What  will  be  the
minimum  feasible  motion  time  T ⁰ =  kT  thus  obtained?   What  are  the  
values  of  the  new  joint
torques τ₁(kt₁) and τ₂(kt₂)?

Exercise  #5

Consider  again  the  2R robot  in  Fig.  3,  with  the  same  definition  of  
joint  variables  and  using  the
same  kinematic  and  dynamic  parameters.   The  robot  is  initially  at  
rest  at  t =  0  in  q(0)  =  q₀.
Provide  the  explicit  expressions  of  all  terms  in  the  following  three  
feedback  control  laws,  each
achieving its own objective.

a.  Global exponential stabilization of the state (q, q˙ ) = (qd, 0),  with 
decoupled transient evolu-
tions of the position errors ei(t) = qd,i−qi(t), i = 1, 2, of the form e₁(t) = 
e₁(0) (1 + 5t) exp(−5t)
and e₂(t) = e₂(0) (2 exp(−5t) − exp(−10t)).

b.  Global  asymptotic  stabilization  of  the  state  (q, q˙ ) = (qd, 0),  
without  knowledge  of  the  robot
inertia matrix.

c.  Exponential stabilization of the end-effector position p = pd      R2  with 
zero velocity p˙  = 0, up
to kinematic singularities.

Exercise  #1

Note first that we are using the absolute angles w.r.t. to the x₀-axis for the 
orientation of the second
to the fourth link (thus, not the Denavit-Hartenberg relative angles).  Also, 
denote by dci > 0 the
distance of the center of mass of link i from joint i, for i = 2, 3, 4.  The 
individual contributions to
the kinetic energy of this 4-dof planar robot are computed as follows.

The kinematics of the first task of dimension m₁ = 2 is given by


r   = p =     q₁ + `(cos q₂ + cos q₃ + cos q₄)     = f

with Jacobian

J  (q) =  ∂f 1(q)  =   1    −` sin q₂    −` sin q₃    −` sin q₄   ,

while the kinematics of the second task of dimension m₂ = 1 is given just by

r₂ = q₂ = f₂(q),


with Jacobian

The augmented Jacobian is then

It is easy to verify that JA(q) is singular, i.e., rank (JA(q)) < 3 = mA(= m₁ + 
m₂), if and only if

cos q₃ = cos q₄ = 0.  This happens when the third and fourth link are aligned 
(or folded) along the

yw  direction.

With reference to Fig. 4, the augmented task requires

 cos vt                                − sin vt  

Setting  now  `  =  h  =  1,  in  order  to  be  consistent  with  the  
augmented  task  at  the  initial  time
t = 0,  there will be multiple robot configurations (q₁, q₃, q₄) that satisfy

effector (task 1) while keeping

A simple choice is to pick q₁ = 8 [m], q₃ = 0, q₄ = −π/2 [rad], as in Fig. 4 
[left].  The configuration

q    =  q(0)  =    8    0    0    −π/2  T   is  not  singular.   Accordingly,  
any  augmented  task  velocity

r˙ d ∈ R3  can  be  instantaneously  realized  (actually  in  a  infinite  
number  of  ways).  The  minimum

norm joint velocity solution is obtained using pseudoinversion (J# = JT (JAJT 
)−¹):

As  a  result,  only  the  third  joint  moves,  rotating  counterclockwise.   
As  shown  in  Fig.  4  [right],
the  first  point  on  the  circle  where  the  augmented  task  necessarily  
encounters  a  singularity  is  at
P    s = (Cₓ, Cy + R) = (7, 3).  The robot arrives there at some instant t = ts

is indeed singular.  Note that this is a true algorithmic  singularity, since 
both tasks are full rank
(rank (J₁(qs))  =  2,  rank (J₂)  =  1)  but  rank (JA(qs))  =  2  <  3  =  mA. 
  Indeed,  one  can  still
compute the pseudoinverse solution, which provides

The prismatic joint retracts,  while joints 3 and 4 will rotate

Thus, the entire velocity task is still satisfied.  In fact, despite the loss 
of rank of the augmented
Jacobian, it is easy to see that r˙ d(ts)          JA(qs)  .  The pseudoinverse 
joint velocity returns then
the  exact solution also in this case.  We note finally that the robot will not 
be able to trace the
entire circle, being the lower part outside its workspace.

Exercise  #3

With reference to Fig. 5, we define the task frame with axis zt normal to the 
plane of motion and
passing through the center of the cylinder base, and axis xt tangential to the 
path on the plane.

The natural constraints are then

fₓ = 0,       fy = 0,       vz = 0,       ωₓ = 0,       ωy = 0,       µz = 0,

in which we neglected any friction effect at the contact.  The complementary 
artificial constraints
are

vₓ = vₓ,d(t) > 0,       vy = 0,       fz = fz,d     0,       µₓ = 0,       µy = 
0,       ωz = ωz,d.

The value of the velocity vy  (normal to the path) is chosen to be zero, 
signifying that the robot
end-effector/payload should strictly follow the path on the plane.  A non-zero 
fz,d can be chosen

so as to enforce full surface contact with the base,  despite of the presence 
of friction (and other
disturbances) in the real world.  The two reaction torques µₓ and µy are set to 
zero, in order not
to stress the object while in contact.  Finally, ωz,d can be set to zero or 
not, depending on whether
the cylinder should keep its orientation or rotate around its major axis while 
the center of its base
is following the path traced on the plane.

Exercise  #4

In this exercise,  we just need to derive the gravity term in the dynamic model 
of the 2R planar
robot.   No  information  is  required  in  fact  on  the  inertial  terms.   
Using  the  Denavit-Hartenberg
coordinates, the q = 0 configuration will correspond to the robot arm being 
stretched downward
along      the x₀-axis, the configuration of minimum potential energy.  
Therefore, being m₁ = m₂ = m
and dc₁ = dc₂ = `/2, the potential energy due to gravity is

U = U₁ + U₂ = −m₁g₀ dc₁ cos q₁ − m₂g₀ (` cos q₁ + dc₂ cos(q₁ + q₂))

= −mg `   3 cos q  + 1 cos(q  + q )  ,

.            (1)

Setting m = 5 [kg],  ` = 0.5 [m] and g₀  = 9.81 [m/s²],  by evaluating (1) at  
q(t₁) = (π/4, 0) and

q(t₂) = (−π/4, 3π/4) we obtain the gravity torques at the two joints

g₁(q(t₁)) = 34.6836  [Nm]        and        g₂(q(t₂)) = 12.2625  [Nm].

The uniform time scaling factor k > 1 needed to recover feasibility of the 
entire motion is computed
from                                                                            
                                                  


k  =      τ₁(t₁) − g₁(q(t₁))

τmₐₓ,₁ − g₁(q(t₁))

as

= 1.2698,       k₂

=      τ₂(t₂) − g₂(q(t₂))

τmₐₓ,₂ − g₂(q(t₂))

= 1.2830,

k = max{k₁, k₂} = 1.2830 (= k₂).


Thus, the second joint is the one with higher relative violation of the torque 
limit (once gravity is
removed).  The motion time is then increased from T = 3 [s] to the new value T 
⁰ = kT = 3.8491 [s],
which is the minimum feasible one under uniform time scaling.  The values of 
the new joint torques
(expressed in [Nm]) at the scaled instants t⁰1  = kt₁ and t⁰2  = kt₂ are 
computed as

τ (t⁰ ) =  τ1(t1) − g1(q(t1)) + g (q(t ) = 98.6589 < 100 = τ        ,


1    1                            k2                            1          1

As expected, the second joint torque will be in saturation at the scaled 
instant t⁰2.

Exercise  #5

The three requested motion tasks are all regulation problems.  The dynamic 
terms needed for the
various feedback control laws are listed first.  We make reference to the 2R 
robot in Fig. 3, with
the same definition of joint variables and using the same parameters.  The 
inertia matrix is

M (q) =     a₁ + 2a₂ cos q₂    a₃ + a₂ cos q₂     ,
a₃ + a₂ cos q₂              a₃

with a₁ = I₁ + I₂ + ³ m`², a₂ =  ¹ m`², a₃ = I₂ + ¹ m`².  The Coriolis and 
centrifugal terms are

2                            2                                       4

c(q, q˙ ) =     −a₂ sin q₂(q˙₂ + 2q˙₁)q˙₂     .

a₂ sin q₂q˙²

The gravity vector has been already computed in Exercise #4, and is rewritten 
here as

g(q) =     a₄ sin q₁ + a₅ sin(q₁ + q₂)

a₅ sin(q₁ + q₂)

with a₄  =  ¹ mg₀`,  a₅  =  ¹ mg₀`.  From the direct kinematics p = f (q),  the 
robot Jacobian that

2                                2

maps the joint velocity q˙  ∈ R2  to the velocity p˙  ∈ R2  of the end effector 
is

J(q) =  ∂f (q)  =   −`(sin q₁ + sin(q₁ + q₂))    −` sin(q₁ + q₂)   .

Finally, we shall need also the time derivative of the Jacobian matrix, namely

J˙ (q) =     −` (cos q₁ q˙₁ + cos(q₁ + q₂) (q˙₁ + q˙₂))    −` cos(q₁ + q₂) (q˙₁ 
+ q˙₂)     .

−` (sin q₁ q˙₁ + sin(q₁ + q₂) (q˙₁ + q˙₂))    −` sin(q₁ + q₂) (q˙₁ + q˙₂)

a.  Global exponential stabilization of the state (q, q˙ ) = (qd, 0),  with 
decoupled transient evolu-
tions of the position errors ei(t) = qd,i−qi(t), i = 1, 2, of the form e₁(t) = 
e₁(0) (1 + 5t) exp(−5t)
and e₂(t) = e₂(0) (2 exp(−5t) − exp(−10t)).

This is obtained by feedback linearization control in the joint space:

u = M (q)a + c(q, q˙ ) + g(q),    with  a = −KD q˙ + KP (qd − q),

with  KP  >  0  and  KD  >  0  and  both  diagonal.   The  desired  error  
transients  are  obtained  by
choosing suitable gains in the linear and decoupled second-order dynamics

e¨i + KD,ie˙i + KP,iei = 0,       i = 1, 2,                                     
  (2)


for the two position errors ei(t) = qd,i   qi(t).  For joint 1, substitute 
e₁(t) = e₁(0) (1 + 5t) exp(   5t)
and its first and second time derivatives in (2):

e₁(0) (−25 + 125t) exp(−5t) − KD,₁ e₁(0) 25t exp(−5t) + KP,₁ e₁(0) (1 + 5t) 
exp(−5t) = 0.

Since e₁(0) exp(−5t) =6   0 for any finite t ≥ 0, this common factor can be 
eliminated so as to obtain
(−25 + 125t) − 25KD,₁t + (1 + 5t) KP,₁ = 0.

By the principle of polynomial identity (w.r.t. the powers of t), this implies

125 − 25 KD,₁ + 5 KP,₁ = 0,    −25 + KP,₁ = 0         ⇒       KP,₁ = 25, KD,₁ = 
10.

Moreover, transforming eq. (2) for i = 1 in the Laplace domain and using these 
values leads to

s² + 25s + 10  e₁(s) = (s + 5)²e₁(s) = 0,

namely, the error dynamics at the first joint is characterized by two real and 
coincident negative
eigenvalues in −5.

We proceed similarly for joint 2.  Substitute  e₂(t) = e₂(0) (2 exp(   5t)     
exp(   10t)) and its  first
and second time derivatives in (2):

e₂(0) (50 exp(−5t) − 100 exp(−10t)) + KD,₂ e₂(0) (−10 exp(−5t) + 10 exp(−10t))

+ KP,₂ e₂(0) (2 exp(−5t) − exp(−10t)) = 0.

Being e₂(0) 6= 0, in order for this expression to vanish identically at all 
times t ≥ 0, we should zero
the coefficients multiplying the two different exponentials exp(−5t) and 
exp(−10t).  This yields

50 − 10 KD,₂ + 2 KP,₂ = 0,    −100 + 10 KD,₂ − KP,₂ = 0         ⇒       KP,₂ = 
50, KD,₂ = 15.

Moreover, transforming eq. (2) for i = 2 in the Laplace domain and using these 
values leads to

s² + 15s + 50  e₂(s) = (s + 5)(s + 10) e₂(s) = 0,

namely,  the error dynamics at the second joint has two real and distinct 
negative eigenvalues in

−5 and −10.

b.  Global  asymptotic  stabilization  of  the  state  (q, q˙ ) = (qd, 0),  
without  knowledge  of  the  robot
inertia matrix.

This  can  be  obtained  by  multiple  choices,  the  most  common  being  a  
PD  control  with  gravity
cancellation

u = KP (qd − q) − KD q˙ + g(q),

with  symmetric  KP  >  0  and  KD  >  0,  typically  chosen  diagonal.   In  
alternative,  one  can  use
gravity compensation

u = KP (qd − q) − KD q˙ + g(qd)

further requiring that the minimum eigenvalue of KP  is larger than a finite 
upper bound α > 0
on the norm of the Hessian ∂²U (q)/∂q² of the gravitational potential energy U 
.


c.  Exponential stabilization of the end-effector position p = pd      R2  with 
zero velocity p˙  = 0, up
to kinematic singularities.

In this case, we require a feedback linearization control in the Cartesian 
space:

u = M (q)J−¹(q)  a − J˙ (q)q˙   + c(q, q˙ ) + g(q),


with

a = −KD p˙ + KP (pd − p) = −KD J(q)q˙ + KP (pd − f (q))

and where KP > 0 and KD > 0 are both chosen diagonal.
