Exercise 1
An automated crane can be seen as a mechanical system with two degrees of freedom that moves
along a horizontal rail subject to the actuation force F , and that transports a swinging link
connected with a passive and frictionless revolute joint, as sketched in Fig. 1. With reference to
the kinematic variables and dynamic parameters defined therein:
• derive the dynamic model of this system using a Lagrangian formalism;
• provide a linear parameterization of the obtained model in terms of a minimal number of
dynamic coefficients;
• provide a linear approximation of the nonlinear model for small variations around the unT
forced equilibrium state x0 = q1 q2 q̇1 q̇2 = 0;
• find the nonlinear state feedback law for the force F = F (x, a) that linearizes exactly the
dynamics of the first coordinate as q̈1 = a.

Exercise 2
The end-effector of a PPR robot moving on a horizontal plane and equipped with a 2D force sensor
should follow a stiff and frictionless linear surface tilted by α > 0 w.r.t. the absolute y axis, starting
T
at time t = t0 in the position ps = xs ys , with a tangential speed Vt = Vt (t0 ) + At (t − t0 )
(with Vt (t0 ) > 0 and a constant At > 0), and applying a constant normal force Fn > 0 (see Fig. 2).
Assuming full knowledge of geometric, kinematic, and dynamic parameters, provide the symbolic
expressions of the initial robot state and explicitly of all terms in the force/torque commands at
the joints that will guarantee perfect execution of the desired task in nominal conditions. Is the
solution unique? If not, provide the simplest one.

Exercise 1
The crane is an underactuated mechanical system with n = 2 degrees of freedom, but with only
a single control command (p = 1). To derive its dynamic model, we can follow a Lagrangian
approach. For this, the position and velocity of the center of mass of the swinging link are1

with g0 = 9.81 [m/s2 ]. Assuming the possible presence of a viscous friction term (with a viscous

Finally, partial feedback linearization of the crane dynamics as concerns the motion of q1 is obtained
as follows. Solve (globally!) for the revolute joint acceleration q̈2 from the second equation in (1),

Exercise 2
Noting that q1 affects the y-coordinate and q2 the x-coordinate, the direct/differential kinematics
of the end-effector position, velocity, and acceleration are given respectively by

where the Jacobian J (q) has been introduced.
The robot has n = 3 joints and the (hybrid) planar task has dimension m = 2 (one in force, the
other in motion/velocity). In the presence of n − m = 1 degree of redundancy, the task can be
executed in an infinite number of ways, beginning right from the different initial choices of an
inverse kinematic configuration q(t0 ) at time t0 , among those associated to the initial Cartesian
point p(t0 ) = ps , and of the initial joint velocity q̇(t0 ), among those associated to the initial
end-effector velocity

It is then possible to parametrize the joint-space motion in terms of one variable. In this case, the
easy choice is to pick the third joint variable q3 as the parametrizing one. We set an arbitrary (but
sufficiently smooth) time profile for it
q3 (t) = β(t),

q̇3 (t) = β̇(t),

∀t ≥ t0 ,

and thus
q3 (t0 ) = β(t0 ),

q̇3 (t0 ) = β̇(t0 ).

As a result, the two prismatic joints will be initialized at

With this in mind, the dynamic model of the planar PPR robot (in the absence of gravity and
without dissipative effects), when in contact with a stiff environment environment takes the form
M (q)q̈ + c(q, q̇) = τ + J T (q)F .

(5)

where F ∈ R2 is the contact force applied by the environment on the robot end-effector (equal and
opposite to the one applied by the robot on the environment) and J has been defined in (2). We
provide next the explicit symbolic expressions of the dynamic terms appearing in (5). Note first
that the position and velocity of the center of mass of the third link are

where the dependence of the inertia matrix M and of the Jacobian J is actually only on q3 = β
and that of the centrifugal terms c is only on q3 = β and q̇3 = β̇. This can be made more explicit

I3 + m3 d2c3 β̈ + m3 dc3 At cos(α − β) − l3 β̈ + Fn l3 sin(α − β)
Note that the first two components of τ d are forces (the units of all terms are [N] = [kg·m/s2 ]),
while the last component is a torque (units in [Nm]). Moreover, thanks to the fact that the initial
5

robot state is matched with the task at the initial time t = t0 , there will be no need of a feedback
action on task errors in the nominal control commands (7) in order to execute the entire task in
ideal conditions.
The above parametrized control law is one of the many realizing the desired task, depending on the
choice of the time evolution β(t) for the variable q3 of the revolute joint. Indeed, simplifications
arise for specific choices. The simplest one is choosing to keep q3 at a constant value β, with
β̇ = β̈ = 0. We obtain

Having chosen to keep the third joint at rest for the entire motion, the robot behaves kinematically
as a 2P robot. In particular, when placing the third robot link normal to the frictionless surface,
we have β = α and the third control component reduces to τd3 = At m3 dc3 .
