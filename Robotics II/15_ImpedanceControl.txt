imposes a desired dynamic behavior to the interaction between
robot end-effector and environment
the desired performance is specified through a generalized dynamic
impedance, namely a complete set of mass-spring-damper equations
(typically chosen as linear and decoupled, but also nonlinear)
a model describing how reaction forces are generated in association
with environment deformation is not explicitly required
suited for tasks in which contact forces should be “kept small”, while
their accurate regulation is not mandatory
since a control loop based on force error is missing, contact forces
are only indirectly assigned by controlling position
the choice of a specific stiffness in the impedance model along a
Cartesian direction results in a trade-off between contact forces and
position accuracy in that direction

Design of the control law

1. feedback linearization in the Cartesian space (with force measure)

𝑢 = 𝐽-. (𝑞) 𝑀A 𝑞 𝑎 + 𝑆A 𝑞, 𝑞̇ 𝑥̇ + 𝑔A 𝑞 − 𝐹𝑥̈ = 𝑎

2. imposition of a dynamic impedance model

rationale ...
avoid large impact forces due to uncertain geometric characteristics
(position, orientation) of the environment
adapt/match to the dynamic characteristics of the environment (in
particular, of its estimated stiffness) in a complementary way
mimic the behavior of a human arm
è fast and stiff in “free” motion, slow and compliant in “guarded” motion

large 𝑀8,V and small 𝐾8,V in Cartesian directions where contact is
foreseen (➔ low contact forces)
large 𝐾8,V and small 𝑀8,V in Cartesian directions that are supposed
to be free (➔ good tracking of desired motion trajectory)
damping coefficients 𝐷8,V are used then to shape transient behaviors

A notable simplification

-1

choose the apparent inertia equal to the natural Cartesian inertia of the robot

𝑀8 = 𝑀A 𝑞 = 𝐽-1. 𝑞 𝑀(𝑞)𝐽-1F(𝑞)
then, the control law becomes

𝑢 = 𝑀 𝑞 𝐽-1F(𝑞)S𝑥̈ H − 𝐽-̇ 𝑞 𝑞̇ } + 𝑆 𝑞, 𝑞̇ 𝑞̇ + 𝑔 𝑞
+ 𝐽-. (𝑞) 𝐷8 𝑥̇ H − 𝑥̇ + 𝐾8 𝑥H − 𝑥
WITHOUT contact force feedback! (a F/T sensor is no longer needed…)

this is a pure motion control applied also during interaction,
but designed so as to keep limited contact forces at the end-effector level
(as before, 𝐾𝑚 is chosen as a function of the expected environment stiffness)
Robotics 2

A notable simplification

-2

technical issue: if the impedance model (now, nonlinear) is still supposed to
represent a real mechanical system, then in correspondence to a desired
non-constant inertia (𝑀A (𝑞)) there should be Coriolis and centrifugal terms...

𝑀A (𝑞) 𝑥̈ − 𝑥̈ H + 𝑆A 𝑞, 𝑞̇ + 𝐷8 𝑥̇ − 𝑥̇ H + 𝐾8 𝑥 − 𝑥H = 𝐹nonlinear impedance model (“only” gravity terms disappear)

redoing computations, the control law becomes

𝑢 = 𝑀 𝑞 𝐽-1F(𝑞)S𝑥̈ H − 𝐽-̇ 𝑞 𝐽-1F 𝑞 𝑥̇ H } + 𝑆 𝑞, 𝑞̇ 𝐽-1F(𝑞)𝑥̇ H + 𝑔 𝑞
+ 𝐽-. (𝑞) 𝐷8 𝑥̇ H − 𝑥̇ + 𝐾8 𝑥H − 𝑥
which is indeed slightly more complex, but has the following advantages:
§ guarantee of asymptotic convergence to zero tracking error (on 𝑥𝑑(𝑡))
when 𝐹- = 0 (no contact situation) ⇒ Lyapunov + skew-symmetry of 𝑀̇ A − 2𝑆A
§ further simplifications when 𝑥𝑑 is constant

Cartesian regulation revisited
(without contact, 𝐹- = 0)

when 𝑥𝑑 is constant (𝑥̇ H = 0, 𝑥̈ H = 0), from the previous expression we get
the control law

𝑢 = 𝑔 𝑞 + 𝐽-. 𝑞 𝐾8 𝑥H − 𝑥 − 𝐷8𝑥̇

(★)

Cartesian PD control with gravity cancellation…
when 𝐹- = 0 (absence of contact), we know already that this control law
ensures asymptotic stability of 𝑥H , provided 𝐽- (𝑞) has full rank

when 𝑥̇ = 𝑥̈ = 0, at a closed-loop system equilibrium it is

which has the unique solution
